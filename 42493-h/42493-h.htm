<span class="f8">ROLY POLY&rsquo;S SICKNESS AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.</span></h2>


<p class="noi">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, massa, I so bad!&rdquo; exclaimed the fat
cook, as he waddled up to the surgeon, with a
most woeful expression of countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, Roly Poly?&rdquo;
inquired Dr. Tourniquet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sich a debble ob a pain, massa,&rdquo; continued
the black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where is it, man? where is it?
Can&rsquo;t do you any good till I know what&rsquo;s
the matter with you, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; said the
surgeon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Debble ob a pain, massa, in my tomack,&rdquo;
replied his patient, rubbing his huge hand over
his stomach, and heaving the most despairing
of sighs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put out your tongue,&rdquo; exclaimed the
doctor.</p>

<p>The fat cook extended a pair of enormous
jaws, and protruded something which resembled
a scorched brick-bat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! derangement of the digestive functions,&rdquo;
remarked the practitioner, after a brief
inspection of the misshapen lump of flesh his
patient had exhibited. &ldquo;What have you been
eating?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eatin, massa?&rdquo; repeated Roly Poly, looking
most ludicrously pathetic, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t eat
nutting, massa, to tink of. Loss nappetite
&rsquo;pletely. Breakfast, me only eat pound and
harp o&rsquo; beef&mdash;berry little lump o&rsquo; cold puddin
big as my two fistes,&rdquo; (which were the size of
another person&rsquo;s head), &ldquo;two or tree red herrin&mdash;harp-a-dozen
egg&mdash;lope o&rsquo; bread, and
one, two quart o&rsquo; cocoa. Nuttin more, me
&rsquo;sure you, massa. Yes, me loss nappetite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
&rsquo;pletely. Den for lunch, me eat pound and
harp o&rsquo; beef&mdash;berry little lump o&rsquo; cold puddin,
big as my two fistes&mdash;two or tree red herrin&mdash;and
drop o&rsquo; liquor wash it down, not more
den harp a gallon, nutting to tink of, massa.
Den for dinner me eat pound and harp o&rsquo; beef&mdash;berry
little lump o&rsquo; hot puddin, big as my
two fistes&mdash;plate or two o&rsquo; wedgeables&mdash;lope o&rsquo;
bread&mdash;small bit o&rsquo; cheese, big as one o&rsquo; my
two fistes&mdash;and drop o&rsquo; liquor wash it down,
not more nor harp a gallon. Can&rsquo;t eat nuttin.
Den for tea me eat pound and harp o&rsquo; beef&mdash;berry
little lump o&rsquo; cold puddin, big as my two
fistes&mdash;two or tree red herrin&mdash;harp-a-dozen
egg&mdash;lope o&rsquo; bread, and one, two quart o&rsquo; cocoa.
Nuttin to tink of. Den for supper, me eat
pound and harp o&rsquo; beef&mdash;berry little lump o&rsquo;
cold puddin, big as my two fistes&mdash;two or tree
red herrin, and two or tree roasted tatoroes&mdash;lope
o&rsquo; bread&mdash;small bit o&rsquo; cheese, big as one o&rsquo;
my two fistes&mdash;and drop o&rsquo; liquor wash it
down, not more nor harp a gallon. Me eat
nuttin, massa. Loss nappetite &rsquo;pletely.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you eat enough to satisfy a regiment,&rdquo;
exclaimed Dr. Tourniquet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, massa, me berry poor eater,&rdquo; replied
the fat cook in a doleful tone; &ldquo;eat nuttin to
sinnify. Ony pound and harp o&rsquo; beef&mdash;berry
little lump o&rsquo; cold puddin&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; I&rsquo;ve heard all that,&rdquo; said the
doctor, impatiently interrupting him. &ldquo;Your
plethoric habit must be reduced, don&rsquo;t you see.
You must be bled and physicked, till we bring
down that mountain of flesh into something
like a healthy size. You must eat no beef, no
pudding, no red herrings, no eggs, and no
cheese; and drink neither liquor nor cocoa.
You must drink nothing but barley water, and
eat nothing but arrow-root; and run up and
down the deck for half an hour, half-a-dozen
times a-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the Doctor described the remedies he
desired his patient to adopt, Roly Poly&rsquo;s mouth
gradually extended itself till it threatened to
approach his ears; and his eyes kept winking
and staring as if in complete consternation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Massa!&rdquo; at last he loudly exclaimed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
seemed gradually becoming more indignant.
&ldquo;What, starve poor nigger! reduce poor Roly
Poly to a natomy! No eat no pound and harp o&rsquo;
beef, no berry little lump o&rsquo; cold puddin big as
my two fistes&mdash;no red herrin&mdash;no nuttin!
You want to kill poor Roly Poly, Sar! You
want to &rsquo;prive de world o&rsquo; de cook what makes
de booflifulest dishes as you nebber see, Sar!
You want to make skeleton o&rsquo; poor nigger to
put in glass-case, Sar! Nebber heard o&rsquo; sich
numanity! sick barbararity&mdash;sich cruelty to
anmals! Where de debble you spect to go when
you die?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t like to follow my prescriptions,
it&rsquo;s no use coming for my advice,
don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; remarked the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow your scriptions?&rdquo; replied his patient,
losing all respect for his companion in the intensity
of his indignation. &ldquo;Follow a shark&rsquo;s
grandmutter, Sar. What, eat nuttin but arrow-root?
nassy slop!&mdash;pooty joke indeed. Drink
nuttin but barley water?&mdash;washy stuff! Tink
you catch me at it. Be bled and physicked,
and run up and down deck six times a day for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
harp an hour&mdash;what a preposterosterous impossumbility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will get much worse if you don&rsquo;t, and
possibly you may die, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; observed
Tourniquet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Die, Massa!&rdquo; cried the fat cook, looking
horrified at the idea, and rubbing his stomach
with an increased energy. &ldquo;Oh, sich a debble
ob a pain! Die Massa! Poor Roly Poly die?
Sich a boofliful cook die! Quite unnatral,
Massa. Oh, sich a debble ob a pain! What
become o&rsquo; de poor fellars who eat him nice
puddins, and soups, and all dat? Nebber hab
no beckfast; nebber hab no lunch; nebber hab
no dinner; nebber hab no tea; nebber hab no
supper; never hab no nuttin! What become
o&rsquo; ebry body? What become o&rsquo; ship? Same o&rsquo;
you say Roly Poly die! Nobody do nuttin
widout him; cook be most important ofcer in
ship. Roly Poly be booflifulest cook as nebber
was. Same o&rsquo; you say Roly Poly die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well you will find out the difference by-and-bye,
don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; said the Doctor; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
turning on his heel, he left his patient to his
own reflections.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Him no more doctor dan a jackmorass,&rdquo;
muttered the fat cook, as he waddled to another
part of the ship, making the most ludicrous
grimaces, and rubbing his stomach with an
activity, that for him, was quite surprising.
On his way he met with Loop, the young midshipman,
who had lately distinguished himself
by his love of mischief, and fondness for tricks.
The lad, with a very demure face, approached
Roly Poly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Roly Poly?&rdquo; he inquired,
looking into his face as if he was wonderfully
interested in the result of his question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sich a debble ob a pain!&rdquo; replied
the fat cook, with a most melancholy visage,
continuing the up and down motion of his
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look very ill, very ill indeed,&rdquo; observed
the boy. &ldquo;What an extraordinary
change! I should scarcely have known you.
You must be in a very dangerous state, Roly
Poly. You ought to be in your hammock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
You ought to be making your will&mdash;you ought
to be saying your prayers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oo, oo, oo!&rdquo; blubbered out the fat cook,
lengthening his face as he listened to the
remarks of his companion. &ldquo;You tink I die,
Massa Loop?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am much afraid you will be as dead as a
herring before you can look about you,&rdquo; replied
Loop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oo, oo, oo!&rdquo; The other continued.
&ldquo;Doctor say I die: you say I die: spose I
must die. Oo, oo, oo!&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are all mortal,&rdquo; observed the youth,
with a grave countenance; &ldquo;and all, sooner
or later, must leave this sublunary world.
Cooks cannot be spared any more than midshipmen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oo, oo, oo!&rdquo; cried Roly Poly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any thing I can do for you?&rdquo;
anxiously inquired the midshipman;&mdash;&ldquo;any
consolation I can afford, before your cold remains
are consigned to the deep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oo, oo, oo!&rdquo; continued the fat cook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have fortitude to bear the blow,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
said Loop, with a countenance that would have
done credit to a judge. &ldquo;Let this be your
consolation, that although your body will be
devoured by the first shark that ventures in its
way&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oo, oo, oo, oo!&rdquo; vehemently sobbed the
sick man, interrupting the sentence before it
was half finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought now to think of your sins,&rdquo;
continued his tormentor. &ldquo;It is never too
late to repent, you know; and I should earnestly
advise you to confess all the injuries you
have done your fellow-creatures by imposing
upon their stomachs the villanous specimens
of your cookery you have from time to time
set before them. Confess upon what pipe-clay
and train-oil system you made your puddings,&mdash;confess
the abominable trash you put together
to manufacture into soups;&mdash;confess how many
you have poisoned with your atrocious cocoa&mdash;confess&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is possible that the young midshipman
might have said much more, but Roly Poly,
who had listened to his injunctions at first with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
astonishment, and next with rage, lost all consideration
for his approaching dissolution, and
his yellow eyeballs flashed with fury. &ldquo;What
de debble you mean you fellar!&rdquo; thundered out
the enraged cook, approaching his companion,
who wisely kept out of arms&rsquo; reach. &ldquo;What
de debble you mean ob pipe-clay and train-oil?
What you mean ob bominable trash&mdash;what
you mean ob poison wid trocious cocoa? You
mean to sult me, Sar? You tink I put up wid
your imprance, Sar? You spose I low one
man to peak sick horble tings o&rsquo; nodder man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man!&rdquo; exclaimed the youth, as he edged
away from his pursuer,&mdash;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t call yourself
a man, surely? You know you&rsquo;re nothing
else but an old blacking bottle, turned inside
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blacka bottle!&rdquo; shouted Roly Poly,
while his face became livid with rage, and he
looked utter annihilation at his insulter,
&ldquo;Blacka bottle! I blacka bottle you, I catch
you!&rdquo; and he waddled after the midshipman
as fast as his fat legs would carry him, intent
upon vengeance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Loop kept dodging him about from one
place to another, saying the most aggravating
things he could think of, till the perspiration
rolled down the black cheeks of the infuriated
cook, and he seemed completely exhausted by
his exertions. Roly Poly sat down at the foot
of one of the masts to rest himself, breathing
all sorts of threatenings against his tormentor;
while the young midshipman, laughing at the
success of his trick, nimbly ascended the yards,
and took up a position just over the head of
the victim of his mischief. The latter was
congratulating himself that he was left at peace,
and was endeavouring to recover the tranquillity
of his temper, when he became conscious
of something dropping down upon him; putting
his hand to his woolly head, he discovered
it was being covered with pitch, and, looking up,
beheld Master Loop snugly balanced aloft,
amusing himself by pouring from an old bucket
some of the fluid that had polluted his person.</p>

<p>It would be in vain attempting to delineate
the passion of the fat cook at this discovery.
Furious with rage, he caught up a small hand-spike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
that lay near, and poised it in his hand
with the intention of throwing it at his tormentor.
Loop saw what he was about to do,
and immediately, as rapidly as possible, moved
from his position, and kept changing from
place to place, with a quickness that baffled
the fat cook&rsquo;s aim; but when he had ascended
to a greater height, and was passing from one
point to another with a velocity that seemed
impossible to be imitated, his foot slipped, and
with a scream that made all on deck aware of
his danger, he fell headlong into the sea.</p>

<p>The Albatross was proceeding at a moderate
rate, and was about fifty miles off the coast of
Spain. Oriel Porphyry was conversing with
Zabra on the quarter-deck, when he noticed
the accident. He, with others, rushed to the
side; and, observing where the boy descended,
he immediately threw off his upper garments,
and plunged into the waves. There was a
strong sea running at the time, and it required
the arm of a powerful swimmer to force a way
through the heaving billows. Upon arriving
at the surface, after his plunge, Oriel struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
out for the spot where the midshipman had
fallen, but saw nothing of the object of his
search. He dived about in every direction;
but was equally unsuccessful. Anxious to
endeavour to save the youth while a possibility
remained of his rescue, he continued his exertions;
but he met with nothing that could in
the slightest degree, assist him in his object.
Not a trace of the boy was to be seen. Disappointed
and weary, he was about returning to
the ship, when he caught the sound of a faint,
bubbling cry at no great distance from him,
and turning his eyes in that direction, he
thought he could distinguish something like a
human head in the trough of an advancing
wave. He swum rapidly in that direction;
and as he approached, saw it disappear from
the surface. Down he dived after it as rapidly
as his skill would allow; but though he swept
the waters, far and near, with his arms, he
touched nothing but the cold salt water; and
after remaining beneath the surface till his
strength and breath were nearly exhausted, he
arose, dispirited and faint, into the open air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>While the most painful reflections were
created in his mind, by the unsuccessful result
of his labours, he suddenly observed a dark substance
rise within a few feet of him; he struck
out towards it in a moment, and grasping it
firmly with his hand, to his deep and inexpressible
delight discovered it to be the body of the
lost midshipman. His face was pallid, his skin
cold, and as Oriel found that he made no reply
to his hurried inquiries, he was much afraid
that the boy was either dead, or was in a state
nearly approaching dissolution.</p>

<p>By this time the ship had been put about,
and the sailors having been made acquainted with
the accident rushed with anxious faces to the
side. They watched with the deepest interest
the young merchant gallantly breasting the waves
in search of their drowning favourite, and became
uneasy as they noticed the unprofitableness
of his efforts. But none regarded the progress
of the swimmer with such intense excitement
of feeling as Zabra. He saw his patron pass
from wave to wave&mdash;he observed him dive into
the dark waters, and waited for his re-appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
with sensations impossible to be described.
As the vessel was brought round to the spot
where Oriel Porphyry was pursuing his researches,
he became more earnest in his attention.
He endeavoured to encourage him in his
efforts with his voice, and to strengthen him in
his purpose by his praise. The captain had not
ascended to the deck, and he was unacquainted
with the accident: but as soon as he was made
aware of it, he hurried to the ship&rsquo;s side in an
agony of apprehension, and it was only the
strong grasp of Boggle and Climberkin that
prevented him from plunging into the sea.</p>

<p>A loud cheer from the crew announced that
the young merchant had succeeded in finding
the object of his solicitude, and anxiously every
eye turned towards the spot where he was seen
supporting the boy with one arm and cleaving
his way through the waves with the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A shark&mdash;a shark!&rdquo; screamed Zabra; and
to the horror of Oriel and those who were
observing him, a monstrous shark was seen
coming rapidly towards him. A cry of terror
arose from the ship. Some shouted in hopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of frightening away the ravenous animal&mdash;others
to warn the young merchant of his danger.
Some ran to get fire arms, and Hearty,
breaking away from those who held him,
suddenly hurried below the deck. The agony
of Zabra became insupportable. He screamed
in all the piercing tones of horror and despair,
and his handsome features seemed convulsed
with fear. Still, as if there was a fascination in
the object, he kept his eyes upon the form of
the shark. He watched its movements with a
fearful interest, and saw it near its intended
victim with wild and frantic terror.</p>

<p>Oriel Porphyry beheld the approach of the
giant of the deep with consternation and dread.
He could not abandon his companion, who was
incapable of making the least exertion for his
own safety, and he saw no way of rescue for
himself. He held the boy tighter, and dashed
along the waves with greater velocity in hopes
of reaching the rope that was hung out from the
ship before the huge animal could come up with
him. To the attainment of this purpose he
strained all his powers. Many friendly voices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
cheered him on, and others strove all they could
to frighten away his remorseless enemy. But
the shark kept on his way, unheeding the
frightful cries and showers of missiles with
which he was assailed. His fierce eyes were
fixed upon his prey, and his monstrous jaws
were gaping for their food. The rope was
almost within reach, but the destroyer was
nearer. Oriel Porphyry gave himself up for
lost. It appeared evident to all that he could
not escape. The crew redoubled their cries
and flung every thing at hand at the monster
without avail. Just as he was turning on his
side to make the fatal gripe, Hearty rushed
upon the deck with a long knife in his hand,
and before any one was aware of his purpose,
he leaped over the side of the ship and descended
into the water close to the jaws of the shark,
with a splash that completely distracted the
animal&rsquo;s attention, and allowed Oriel Porphyry
unmolested to seize the rope which the eager
sailors held to assist him in regaining the vessel.
In a moment, with his lifeless burthen still
grasped in his arm, he was hawled upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
deck, and then placing him under the care of Dr.
Tourniquet, he was turning to notice the result
of the Captain&rsquo;s man&oelig;uvre when he found himself
seized by the friendly grasp of Zabra, whose
delight at his escape appeared to have taken
away all power of utterance.</p>

<p>But now an extraordinary scene presented
itself upon the sea. The shark had dived below
the surface, when Hearty suddenly dashed down
before him; but on rising again, which he very
shortly did, and on perceiving his prey escape,
he turned with increased ferocity towards the
hardy seaman, who was rejoicing at the success
of his scheme. The old man waited quietly till
the shark turned to make a snap at him, then
diving quickly under his enormous belly, he
plunged the knife up to the hilt in his body,
and rose up on the other side. The crew
cheered vociferously when they saw what their
captain was about, and every one on board
watched the unequal combat with feelings of
the most intense interest. The ravenous
monster, smarting with pain, again approached
his opponent; again he turned to gripe him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
within his jaws, and again the old man diving
under his belly, plunged his knife deep into his
flesh. The animal now became furious; he
lashed the waves with his tail till they became
a mass of foam, and rapidly followed his brave
antagonist, making every effort to devour him;
but the old man warily avoided all his ferocious
attempts, and at every blow of his arm crimsoned
the water with his blood. This fight
continued for several minutes, till both the
combatants disappeared from the surface, when
the anxious crew of the Albatross began to fear
that their brave old commander had fallen a
sacrifice to his exertions; but when they beheld
the huge fish floating on the water belly upwards,
and heard the old man cry out for a
rope, a long and hearty cheer rose from the
ship, and every one rushed to bear a hand in
assisting him on board.</p>

<p>He appeared covered with the blood of the
slaughtered shark, and with the weapon in his
hand, of which he had made such good service.
While he was receiving the congratulations of
his messmates, he inquired eagerly after his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
young relative. Oriel, who had ascertained that
he was doing well, hastened to communicate
the intelligence; and the old man as soon as he
beheld the preserver of his boy, eagerly grasped
his hand, and uttered his grateful thanks.
Both soon afterwards left the deck to change
their apparel.</p>

<p>Among those who seemed most anxious for
the recovery of the young midshipman was
Roly Poly, who, although exceedingly passionate,
and easily enraged, was a very good
hearted sort of creature, and he quite forgot the
insults he had received&mdash;forgot even the terrible
pains that had a short time since so much
alarmed him, when he witnessed the dangers
to which the boy had been exposed, and saw
him brought lifeless upon the deck. He assisted
Dr. Tourniquet in using the usual means for
restoring suspended animation, and observed
his recovery with a delight equal to that of any
one in the ship.</p>

<p>After Loop was able to walk about, Roly
Poly addressed him with a great deal of gravity
upon the offence he had committed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nebber you gain call me Blacka Bottle,&rdquo;
said the fat cook. &ldquo;Nebber you say nuttin
scandabalous bout de boofliful tings what I
cook. Nebber you say no preposterosterous
impossumbilities. Horble ting, massa Loop, to
call Roly Poly Blacka Bottle&mdash;Horble ting to
say nuttin scandabalous&mdash;Horble ting to say
preposterosterous impossumbilities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never say any thing against you again,
Roly Poly, as long as I live,&rdquo; exclaimed the
contrite midshipman: and thus ended the quarrel;
and ever afterwards they were the best
friends in the ship.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_II" id="CHAP_II">CHAP. II.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">AN AUSTRALIAN COLONY IN SPAIN.</span></h2>


<p class="noi">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">We</span> are approaching the Colony to which
you thought of emigrating, are we not?&rdquo;
inquired Oriel Porphyry of the captain&rsquo;s clerk,
who stood beside him on the deck, and with
whom he had been in earnest conversation
concerning the misfortunes of the young
Australian.</p>

<p>An expression of pain and regret passed
over Ardent&rsquo;s countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes it was here,&rdquo; he replied making a
violent effort to conquer his emotion. &ldquo;We
were destined to the penal settlement of New
Sydney on the Spanish coast, thriving accounts
of which were in circulation in Australia. My
brothers were desirous of a location somewhere
near the banks of the Guadalquivir, as,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
although it was thinly settled, the land was
said to be of a very superior quality. My father
was of the same inclination. I had no other
wish than to accompany them. Optima was
anxious for nothing but to be with me. But,
alas! the devouring flame, or the equally unrelenting
flood has swallowed up all. I am a
wanderer and a beggar.&mdash;I have neither kin
nor country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say not so,&rdquo; replied the young merchant
kindly. &ldquo;I have not forgotten the services
you have rendered me, nor am I likely to pass
them by without notice. If you wish to settle
at the colony, I will take care you shall have
the means of doing so with every hope of
success; or if you have no particular inclination
towards any country, if you will return with
me to Columbia, you may depend upon meeting
with many kind friends, and may pass the rest
of your life in comfort. I must touch at New
Sydney as I expect a letter from my father,
from whom I have not for some time had any
communication, which makes me exceedingly
anxious; and if you hear of any desirable farm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
or plot of land, I wish you would let me
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your kindness is overpowering,&rdquo; said Ardent,
much affected. &ldquo;I have done nothing
to deserve it. I have already been rewarded
in a manner far exceeding my deserts. But
while I can be of any service, I should like to
remain with you. I have no ties to bind me
to any country&mdash;and where I can be useful
is where I should like to dwell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it shall be then,&rdquo; added Oriel Porphyry.
&ldquo;Be satisfied that the remainder of your life
shall bear no comparison with what has preceded
it. We are now nearing the shore. I
shall require your services as I have some
business to transact; therefore you will be
good enough to prepare to land with me immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the Albatross approached the coast, the
buildings of a small seaport became distinguishable.
Some large houses faced the sea,
and a battery commanded the entrance to the
port; but with the exception of one or two
streets running at right angles, the buildings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
straggled about with very little pretensions to
regularity. The country seemed thinly inhabited,
yet looked fertile and picturesque.
Broad hills and valleys and noble views were
observable in the distance;&mdash;a wild and lofty
rock rose along the coast; and forests of
noble trees were spread out in various directions.
There was no shipping in the bay,
except a few small craft; but the beach was
crowded with spectators. It was observed that,
among the hundreds who were watching the
progress of the ship from the shore, there was
only one female: the rest were men, and they
were apparently of all ages, but principally
men in the prime of life and in the full vigour
of health. The appearance of only one woman
surrounded by such an assemblage of the other
sex seemed so remarkable, that it attracted the
attention of all on board. As the ship entered
the bay, several boats were put off, and the
crew of each seemed to strain every nerve in
endeavouring to get first alongside the vessel.
In a few minutes the Albatross was boarded
by several different parties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How many women have you?&rdquo; cried one;
as soon as he reached the deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see your cargo of female emigrants,&rdquo;
demanded another as he bustled up
to the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want a wife!&rdquo; shouted a third.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have no women here,&rdquo; exclaimed Hearty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No women!&rdquo; cried they in full chorus,
looking as disappointed as men could be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; replied the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! have you brought us no wives?&rdquo;
asked one in a most doleful tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said Hearty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tarnation!&rdquo; exclaimed they; and they
looked at each other with all the eloquence of
mute despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little un &rsquo;ill do for me!&rdquo; squeaked out a
dumpy sort of fellow, with a red nose and a
pepper-and-salt waistcoat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got neither little nor big!&rdquo; responded
the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tarnation!&rdquo; again exclaimed the bachelors;
and, slowly and despondingly, they prepared
to leave the ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now ar&rsquo;nt you got nothing feminine of no
kind?&rdquo; earnestly asked a sharp-visaged, lanky-looking
settler, who seemed very loth to leave
the ship. &ldquo;If she&rsquo;s a nigger, I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you we&rsquo;ve got no women at all!&rdquo;
said old Hearty, rather sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tarnation!&rdquo; muttered the disappointed
colonists: and in a short time after they had
reached the land, there was scarcely a creature,
with the exception of the female already alluded
to, to be seen on the beach. They had
been expecting a ship laden with female emigrants,
and as they were very much in want of
wives, imagining the Albatross to be the much
wished for vessel, they had been excessively
eager to behold the cargo. The incident
created considerable amusement among the
voyagers. The sailors were particularly merry
upon the occasion; and the rueful visages
of the unfortunate colonists afforded many a
hearty laugh.</p>

<p>Oriel had landed, and was walking along the
beach, when he was startled by a short, quick
scream, and turning round, beheld the female<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
who had previously attracted his attention,
rush into the arms of the captain&rsquo;s clerk. He
had noticed, on his approach to the shore,
that this woman, who from her dress appeared
to be a domestic servant, seemed to regard the
persons in the boat with an anxious scrutiny;
but imagining it to be the effect of curiosity,
it did not excite in him any remark. Ardent,
at this rencontre, seemed to be in a state of
surprise and wonder that kept him speechless.
He gazed upon the prepossessing features of the
fair stranger as earnestly as if he had no other
faculty than that of seeing. The kind and
anxious look that met his own&mdash;the arms that
clasped his neck so firmly, and the gentle voice
that murmured his name, convinced him of a
fact of which he was almost incredulous. It
was Optima.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By what fortunate chance did you escape
the death I felt assured that you had met
with?&rdquo; inquired Ardent, after, at Oriel&rsquo;s request,
he had for the purpose of privacy retired
to a chamber in one of the neighbouring habitations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;When I found the boat sinking, I clung to
it,&rdquo; replied his companion; &ldquo;and when it again
rose to the surface I floated on it. The blow
which it had received from the ship had propelled
it a considerable distance, and the force
of the waves carried it still farther. The
plunge I had received, for some minutes took
my breath away; and, although I held on with
all my strength to the boat, the heavy waves
continually breaking upon me, and the alarming
position in which I found myself placed, made
me quite incapable of uttering a sound. As
soon as I was able to comprehend the extent
of my danger, the thought that I was separated
from you, and the fear that you had perished
in the sea, made my heart sink within me.
I clung instinctively to the floating vessel; but
I had no desire to live. I had seen enough of
that dreadful conflagration to fill me with terror;
and I had not recovered from the feelings
it occasioned, when I was left alone, friendless,
and about to be engulphed in the waters. All
around me was so dark that I could see
nothing; but the saltwater, as it dashed over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
me, scarcely allowed me to open my eyes if I
could have seen, and my strength was being
rapidly exhausted. I soon sunk into a state of
stupor. How long this lasted I do not know;
but on recovery, I found myself in a cabin, receiving
every attention that my wants required;
and, on inquiry, I found that I had been
picked up by the crew of a ship, which, attracted
by the glare of the burning vessel, had
sent out a boat, in hopes of affording assistance
to the survivors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was saved in a similar manner,&rdquo; remarked
Ardent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When they had taken me into the
boat they did not proceed any farther,&rdquo; continued
Optima, &ldquo;as they observed that another
vessel had sent out a boat&rsquo;s crew upon the same
errand, and having no spare time at their command,
they left the other boat to pick up the
survivors, and returned with me to the ship.
I discovered also that the vessel to which I had
been conveyed had left Sydney with emigrants
for the very colony to which we were proceeding.
I told my story to my preservers, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
who heard it were kind and compassionate.
An offer was made me by the wife of a settler to
remain with her in the capacity of domestic
servant, which offer I accepted without hesitation.
One thing was a great consolation to
me, and that was the conviction that you had
been saved. I knew that you were a strong
swimmer, and as I had been told that a party
had been sent from the ship to rescue the crew
of the boat they had run down, I concluded
that you were in safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were right, dear Optima!&rdquo; said the
captain&rsquo;s clerk; &ldquo;I was taken on board that
ship, and have since held in it a responsible
situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believing you to have been rescued, I continued
to live, with the hope that I should meet
you again,&rdquo; continued Optima. &ldquo;I arrived at
the colony. The persons whose protection I had
accepted, settled at Sydney, where the husband
commenced business as a builder, in which he
succeeded beyond his expectations. I was very
well treated, and labour being exceedingly
valuable in the colony, my exertions were rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
profitable to me. At that time I entertained
the idea that as all our property was consumed
in the fire, you must be very much in want of
a variety of comforts to which you had been
used; and as the expectation of my meeting you
again was never absent from me, I laboured
diligently, and saved all my earnings as a provision
for our future support.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ardent could only look his gratitude, and
rapturously kiss the hand he held in his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was such a pleasure to me, dear Ardent,&rdquo;
resumed his companion, &ldquo;to count my gains as
fast as they accumulated, and I kept saying to
myself &lsquo;a little more and there will be enough
to begin the world again with;&rsquo; and I thought
how happy I should be able to make you, and
I kept hoping we should soon meet&mdash;and every
day passed by in imagining what we should do,
and in enjoying a happiness of my own creating.
Every time I heard that a ship was in the bay,
I came down to the beach in hopes of finding
you among the passengers. I scrutinised every
one that left the vessel so closely that I offended
some and surprised others; but although I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
met with repeated disappointments, I never left
off expecting your arrival. By this time I had
saved about two hundred dollars, and whether
it became known, or whether the scarcity of
females brought me into such consideration, I do
not know; but scarcely a day passed without my
receiving an offer of marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An offer of marriage!&rdquo; exclaimed Ardent
in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear Ardent,&rdquo; replied Optima.
&ldquo;The men seemed frantic after me. I was
not safe any where. If I went to pay a bill,
it was sure to conclude on the part of the
tradesman with an offer of his hand and heart.
If I entered the market, no sooner had I made
a purchase than I received a proposal. I was
besieged in all hours and at all places,&mdash;I may
almost say that I received a new suitor at the
corner of every street. It was in vain I told
them I was married, and showed them my wedding
ring. They saw that I had no husband
with me, and they were desirous of supplying
his place; and men even of a superior rank
continually plagued me with their proposals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
It is scarcely necessary to say that I gave them
all a negative answer; but these were things that
they did not appear to understand, for the more
frequently I refused, the more frequently they
again proposed. At last I was obliged to state
how I was situated to the lady with whom I
was staying, and she spoke to her husband;
and he took measures that put an end to the
persecution. And now, dear Ardent, that my
anticipations are realised, we will be so very
happy&mdash;won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is easier to imagine what was the answer
than to describe it. It is sufficient to say that
Oriel Porphyry made a considerable addition
to the two hundred dollars which the devoted
Optima had saved, that enabled the young
couple to take a promising farm up the country,
with every prospect of enjoying a life of continued
happiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very strange,&rdquo; remarked the young
merchant to Zabra on his return to the ship,
&ldquo;it is very strange that I have had no communication
from my father. I expected one
at Athenia, but I received no intelligence. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
expected one at Constantinople&mdash;there I met
with the same result; and I then made sure of
meeting with one at New Sydney, but was there
equally unsuccessful. It makes me very uneasy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly he may have nothing of importance
to write about,&rdquo; replied Zabra. &ldquo;Things
at Columbia may remain in the same state as
at his last despatch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. I doubt that the emperor will
remain satisfied with his prerogatives curtailed
to the extent to which they have lately been
reduced,&rdquo; said Oriel Porphyry. &ldquo;There is no
sincerity in these men. They will break any
compact when it suits their convenience. They
have no notion of either honour or honesty:
and the emperor is a weak, vain, foolish man,
proud, tyrannical, and deceitful. Such a man
must be ever scheming to regain his former
power; and if he think it be practicable he will
not be particular as to the means he will employ
for that purpose. I am much afraid my father
has fallen a sacrifice to his patriotism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It cannot be,&rdquo; observed his companion.
&ldquo;They would not dare harm him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dare!&rdquo; echoed his patron. &ldquo;What evil
will not bad men dare? And did not that
proud upstart Philadelphia load his honourable
limbs with chains and thrust him into a loathsome
dungeon to die the lingering death of
starvation? He dared do that, and I doubt
much whether a worse villainy could have been
perpetrated. I hope to live to see the time
when I shall have an opportunity of bringing
him to an account for these and other atrocities.
If my good sword be true, and my arm has lost
none of its power, I&rsquo;ll not leave his worthless
body till I have relieved it of his equally worthless
soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Zabra, with considerable
excitement, &ldquo;would you be thus revengeful
to the father of Eureka? You too, who a short
time since seemed ready to forgive him all his
errors on account of his relationship to her.
What has changed you? Why would you
follow the bad examples of bad men? That
he is not what he should be is too true; but
that is no reason why you should become his
executioner. Do you think that Eureka could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
regard you with affection when you came to her
stained with her father&rsquo;s blood? I am surprised
that you should have given utterance to such a
sentiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew not till lately the atrocities he had
committed, and the savage disposition he possessed,&rdquo;
replied the young merchant; &ldquo;and I
can see no more harm in killing such a monster
than there is in destroying a mad beast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How different then your feelings must be
to those of your father,&rdquo; observed the other.
&ldquo;He knew what was due to humanity, and
practised it, and he was the person best entitled
to call for vengeance, but he was satisfied with
justice. Professing the regard you do towards
Eureka, nothing could surprise me more than to
hear you proclaim so inhuman a wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is impossible for me to help feeling exasperated
against him,&rdquo; said Oriel. &ldquo;Imagine
for a moment yourself in my situation. Let
your father be as mine is, the kindest and
noblest of his species; know that he who never
did harm to any living creature, but sought to
create happiness throughout the world&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
fettered and reviled, and left lingering in filth
and darkness for three days, enduring all the
pangs of famine; and if you have a heart within
your breast, and a soul that hates the cowardly
vices of despotism, you will feel as I do, and
long for an opportunity to punish your father&rsquo;s
persecutor, in a manner worthy of his crimes.
I know that your relationship to the offender
must stand in the way of your seeing the justice
of the punishment I would inflict: but I
am no hypocrite Zabra. I cannot disguise my
detestation of such a monster; and although
next to Eureka and my father I honour you,
even your opposition would not make me
change a sentiment so natural and appropriate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave Philadelphia to his own feelings,
which sooner or later will be sufficient punishment,&rdquo;
responded Zabra. &ldquo;Touch him not if
you value the love of Eureka. She I know has
little cause to feel much affection for him, but
bad as he is she never can be brought to look
upon his destroyer with any feeling save that
of repugnance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that be the case I hope he will keep out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of my way,&rdquo; rejoined the young merchant;
&ldquo;for I think I could endure anything rather
than her dislike; but the absence of intelligence
from my father has certainly made me suspicious.
I am almost determined to return to
Columbia without proceeding to England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think such a course advisable,
Oriel,&rdquo; observed Zabra. &ldquo;There may be a
thousand things that prevent your father&rsquo;s correspondence,
or he may have written, and the
despatches may have been lost. If this be the
case, and there is a great probability that it is,
he would be very much vexed at your returning
without having accomplished your voyage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I will proceed, but I will only make
a brief stay among the antiquities of England,
and then steer direct for Columbia,&rdquo; replied
Oriel Porphyry: &ldquo;I have very strong doubts
about things being exactly right there. The
accounts I have heard are of a contrary tendency;
but if the storm is to be, it will come
unexpected. If any attempt be made by the
government to restore the old order of things,
I hope they will have the goodness to wait till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
my return before they commence their proceedings.
There is a powerful regiment of
horse, composed of the young citizens of Columbus,
of which I have the command; I believe
that they are devoted to my will; and even
with these, although they are not above a
thousand strong, I would make such a stand as
would soon bring around me all the brave spirits
in the country: I only wish for an opportunity
to try the experiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you never dismiss these delusive
visions,&rdquo; said his young friend, anxiously. &ldquo;I
thought that you were at last becoming reconciled
to a more useful and amiable way of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been deceived, Zabra,&rdquo; observed
Oriel; &ldquo;I have been more quiet, but not less
ambitious. This passion for glory has become
a part of my nature; it is with me at all times.
I think of it and dream of it. It is the anticipation
of finding the opportunity for greatness
that makes me able to endure the tedious inactivity
of my present mode of existence. I
shall never be satisfied till I acquire the power
for which I yearn.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What an unhappy nature yours must be
then,&rdquo; replied Zabra. &ldquo;You have every hope
of happiness within your reach; yet because it
does not come clothed in the gorgeous draperies
in which you wish it to appear, you seem desirous
of dismissing it, as of not sufficient value
to be enjoyed. I had hoped that you had become
wiser; I had hoped, too, that you had
been more solicitous for the happiness of
Eureka. I am afraid all my labour has been
thrown away, and that I shall have to return
to her with the intelligence that your ambitious
hopes have stifled every feeling of affection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you wrong me,&rdquo; exclaimed the
young merchant, &ldquo;you wrong me exceedingly.
My aspirations for greatness are never separate
from my hopes of Eureka; because the first
are merely the result of the latter. It is
useless attempting to check the impulses which
urge me on. I must be what I am; and while
my state of being, and the purposes which it
creates and would see fulfilled, cannot in any
way dishonour Eureka, nothing will convince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
me that they are to be condemned. From my
own knowledge of her character, I cannot
imagine that she would regard my efforts for
advancement with the feeling which you have
stated she possesses. Her own greatness of
soul must bring her to look with commendation
on another, who evinces a desire to obtain a
similar greatness: this ambition is a passion
so entirely of her own creating, that she cannot,
with any justice, be displeased with its
exhibition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How little you seem to know of the nature
of her whose love you possess,&rdquo; replied Zabra,
in a low, tremulous voice; &ldquo;no doubt, she
would feel gratified at any circumstance which
would exalt you in the estimation of your
countrymen. The honour you might receive
would be her glory as much as yours, and the
fame you might obtain would find none more
desirous of its security than herself. But it
was not for these things that she loved you.
Ambition formed no part of the qualities that
called into existence her admiration&mdash;which,
having acquired its full growth, cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
made more perfect by the greatness you covet;
and that admiration must continue as long as
the qualities that called it into operation exist.
But knowing your desire to acquire renown,
and knowing the nature of that feeling is to
swallow up all the more amiable aspirations,
and being aware that the only way to its acquirement
is through a thousand terrible
dangers, she cannot help the conviction, that
she would rather possess your affection as you
were, than live in continual fear, to witness
your superiority, as you may be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us say no more about it,&rdquo; said Oriel.
&ldquo;It is very evident that neither can convince
the other. I may be positive that I am going
right, and you may be positive that I am going
wrong; but it is time spent to no purpose,
if we cannot be brought to change our opinions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember, I am only doing my duty,&rdquo;
replied the youth. &ldquo;I warn you, because the
path you desire to take is surrounded by
dangers. If you are determined on going on,
I say, go on and prosper; but if you go on, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
fail, the bitter disappointment you will experience
will not only render yourself miserable,
but must make equally unhappy her whose
felicity you appear so desirous of creating.
If you must go on, Oriel, I say again&mdash;go on,
and prosper.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_III" id="CHAP_III">CHAP. III.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">OLD ENGLAND.</span></h2>


<p class="noi">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">We</span> are approaching the British Islands,
are we not?&rdquo; inquired Oriel Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir, the land lies right ahead,&rdquo; replied
the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are several of these islands, I believe,&rdquo;
added the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are a great number on &rsquo;em o&rsquo; different
sorts and sizes,&rdquo; said Hearty; &ldquo;but
them as is most visited are England and
Ireland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of the prefix to the
word land in each of these names?&rdquo; asked
Oriel of the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;England or Ingle-land means the land of
the fire side,&rdquo; replied Fortyfolios. &ldquo;Ingle is
an old British word meaning the fire at which
the inhabitants of a house warmed themselves
or cooked their food. The natives have been
from the earliest times, famous for their love of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the comforts of this fire, which was usually
made of coal dug out of the earth, that made a
cheerful blaze in a room, and their attachment
to their ingles procured the island the name of
Ingle-land, which, in course of time was abbreviated
into the name of England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt that very much, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo;
here observed Dr. Tourniquet; &ldquo;for in my
opinion, England has a totally different derivation.
The aborigines of the island were
principally fishermen, and very appropriately
had given to them the name of angle-ers, which
means people who fish. Each separate kingdom
was called a kingdom of the Angles, from the
natives using an angle, and the whole island
was called Angle-land, or the land of the angle,
which for shortness was soon afterwards called
England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis nothing of the kind, Dr. Tourniquet,&rdquo;
rejoined the professor warmly. &ldquo;I wonder
you should have started such an absurd idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is quite as reasonable as yours at any
rate, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; remarked the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has no such pretension,&rdquo; said the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in a decided manner. &ldquo;I can prove that the
fire or ingle was a national characteristic of the
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I can prove that fishing or angle-ing
was a national characteristic of the people,&rdquo;
added his antagonist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; exclaimed one, contemptuously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pish!&rdquo; cried the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ingle-land,&rdquo;&mdash;resumed the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Angle-land,&rdquo;&mdash;said the doctor, interrupting
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Dr. Tourniquet, I beg I may not be
interrupted by your ridiculous blunders,&rdquo; observed
Fortyfolios with considerable asperity,
and a look of dignity peculiar to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The blunder is on your side, don&rsquo;t you
see,&rdquo; replied the surgeon, with a chuckle of
satisfaction exceedingly annoying to his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind if it be Ingle-land or Angle-land,&rdquo;
exclaimed Oriel Porphyry. &ldquo;All we
know for certain is, that it is now called
England. But how do you account for the
adoption of the other name?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the derivation of that word there can
be no doubt&mdash;it explains itself,&rdquo; said Fortyfolios.
&ldquo;Ireland means the land of ire. The
natives from time immemorial have been known
to be excessively irascible. They would quarrel
upon the slightest cause, and fight from no
cause at all. They would fight when they
were hungry, upon which occasion, as was very
natural, they fought for a belly-full. They
would fight for liquor; they would fight for
fun; they would fight for love; they would
fight to get drunk, and then fight to get sober.
The happiest men among them were those who
were most frequently beaten, and such persons
were known to be the best friends as were
continually trying to knock out each other&rsquo;s
brains. These men consequently got the appropriate
name of Ire-ishmen, and the island
was called Ire-land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you&rsquo;re wrong again, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo;
observed Tourniquet. &ldquo;The name Ire-land
was derived from Higher-land, to express that
the country was more elevated in the estimation
of the natives than any other part of the globe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
They entertained the most preposterous ideas
about the importance of their island. They
stated that when the rest of the world was sunk
in barbarism, their Higher-land was the seat of
intelligence, and virtue, and superior bravery.
They asserted that their soldiers were the only
soldiers that ever existed, and that their agricultural
labourers were &lsquo;the finest pisantry in
the world.&rsquo; But there was certainly something
very singular about them; and even their brick-layers&rsquo;
labourers were odd men. The island
was also called by the natives The Emerald
Island, I believe because it sometimes produced
Irish diamonds. The Green Isle was another
of its names&mdash;and this was derived from the
greenness of the people. The men went by the
name of &lsquo;the boys&rsquo; long after the age at which
other boys became men; and even the oldest of
the old men among them, when he breathed
his last, was said to die in a green old age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is extraordinary to me, Dr. Tourniquet,
that you will give utterance to such fallacies,&rdquo;
remarked the professor. &ldquo;The facts are
exactly as I have stated them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The facts are exactly as I have stated
them,&rdquo; said the other with marked emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was there not a very celebrated character
styled St. Patrick, who flourished at one time
among the Irish?&rdquo; inquired the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly there was,&rdquo; replied Fortyfolios.
&ldquo;Patrick, Pater Rick&mdash;or Rick being the
abbreviation of Richard&mdash;Father Richard, was
a poor monk&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I deny!&rdquo; eagerly exclaimed the
doctor. &ldquo;For, as it is stated in a very ancient
poem I have met with,</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&lsquo;St. Patrick was a gintleman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And born of dacent paple.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;That is no authority,&rdquo; resumed Fortyfolios.
&ldquo;I affirm that he was a poor monk
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I maintain that he was a gentleman,&rdquo;
replied the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I insist that you do not interrupt me, Dr.
Tourniquet,&rdquo; exclaimed the professor angrily.
&ldquo;He was an exceedingly pious and virtuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
man, and by his example and precepts did a
great deal of good among his countrymen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the surgeon, gravely, &ldquo;I have
met with an authority that says</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&lsquo;He gave the frogs and toads a twist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And banished all the varmint.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">Now the usual reading of this couplet is that
he drove the frogs and toads out of the country;
but if we look to the meaning of the word twist,
we shall find that it means an appetite: a man
with a twist means a man with a certain facility
in swallowing anything eatable that comes before
him; and as we know that frogs at one
time were considered a great delicacy by the
ancients, it is not unreasonable to imagine that
St. Patrick was a great epicure, and swallowed
all the frogs and toads in the island.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Preposterous!&rdquo; exclaimed Fortyfolios; &ldquo;he
was a saint whose prayers had the efficacy of
ridding the country of every venomous thing it
contained. But there is a remarkable legend
connected with his history, which I will relate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to you as I found it in a very ancient poem
preserved in the Columbian Museum. It
appears that he was one fast day on a visit at a
house, and he desired dinner might be brought
to him; but the family having already dined
there was no fish, the usual food for fast days,
for his meal; in fact there was nothing eatable
in the larder but a leg of mutton. With great
regret the people of the house acquainted him
with the real state of the case: but the good
saint, with a benevolent smile, as the poet
describes, merely said,</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&lsquo;Send my compliments down to the leg<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bid it come hither a salmon.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;And what was the result?&rdquo; inquired Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To use the simple and expressive words
of the poem,&rdquo; replied the professor, with his
usual gravity,</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;And the leg most politely complied.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;You see those white cliffs just beginning to
show &rsquo;emselves,&rdquo; said the captain, pointing to
the distant coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I see them plainly,&rdquo; replied the young
merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the coast of England, Sir,&rdquo; added
Hearty. Oriel Porphyry gazed on the classic
shores that were rising before him with a
deep and peculiar interest. He had read so
much, and he had heard so much of the glory
of the country he was approaching, and of the
greatness of her people, that the first sight of
land awakened in him the most agreeable
associations. He thought of the splendour of
her achievements&mdash;he thought of the magnificence
of her power&mdash;he thought of her
illustrious men&mdash;he thought of her noble efforts
in the advance of intelligence&mdash;and the white
cliff upon which he was gazing appeared to him
to be the most interesting portion of the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The appearance of the shore from the sea
at one time conferred on England the name of
Albion,&rdquo; said the professor. &ldquo;From <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alba</i>
white&mdash;from which word many other names
were derived, particularly <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">album</i>&mdash;a white
book in great request at one time among the
females of the island, to teach them the art of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
spoiling paper for the benefit of the stationers&mdash;and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">albumen</i>, the white of an egg, a sort of
food in great request with the chicken-hearted.
Some of the natives of Albion carried their
attachment to the name so far that they lived
in a place which they designated <em>the Albany</em>,
and had a favourite place of resort which they
called &lsquo;Whites.&rsquo; There was also a certain
building situated in <em>White</em> Cross Street, to
which they proceeded, to show their nationality,
by getting <em>white</em>-washed. The females
were remarkable for a partiality to white bread,
white wine, and white linen, and the males
evinced an equal fondness for white bait, white
waistcoats, and white hands, and to such an
extent did this favouritism for a particular colour
extend, that there was a neighbouring island,
called the Isle of White, to which the inhabitants
of Albion made occasional journeys, for
the pleasure of destroying white ducks, or
white muslin: and it was usual for every
generation to be christened in white, to be
married in white, and to be buried in white.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are these vessels approaching us in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
this threatening manner,&rdquo; inquired Oriel Porphyry,
as he noticed several old crazy-looking
boats filled with men who were coming towards
them with their crews, howling, screeching,
and yelling with all the strength of their
lungs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think they mean us any good,&rdquo;
replied the captain: then turning to some of the
sailors standing scrutinising the appearance of
a strange fleet, evidently bearing down upon
them, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Get the long gun ready,
and give these fools a taste of grape if they
attempt to attack us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay! Sir,&rdquo; replied one of the men; and
every disposition was made to repel any assault
that might be attempted.</p>

<p>As they approached nearer, it was observed
that these vessels were a vast number of large
open boats, some with sails, but most without,
and they were so crammed with men, that
many of them were in danger of sinking every
minute. Their crews were clothed in ragged
vestments of every colour and description, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
they were armed with old swords, pistols,
guns, pitchforks, and bludgeons, and these they
displayed as they advanced, shouting all the
time in wild savage tones perfectly deafening.
A larger boat was in advance of the others,
and in a conspicuous situation in this vessel
stood up a tall fierce-looking man with his
head bound round with a hay-band, and a
tattered blanket dropping from his shoulders.
He brandished a rusty sword as he approached,
and gave orders to those who followed, which
appeared to meet with implicit obedience.
When he came within gun-shot of the Albatross,
he turned round to his followers and
addressed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, pointing to the ship,
&ldquo;yonder&rsquo;s the furreners. It&rsquo;s meself as &rsquo;ill
take their big baste iv a ship if ye&rsquo;ll be all to
the fore. Divle a care ye may take ov their
darty guns that their pointing at yese&mdash;its
made ov wood they are, and sorrow a harm
they can do, bad luck to &rsquo;em. Keep your
powther dry, boys, and look to your flints, and
iv we don&rsquo;t kill and murther and throttle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
every mother&rsquo;s son ov &rsquo;em, I&rsquo;m not King
Teddy O&rsquo;Riley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sheer off there, you ragamuffins,&rdquo; shouted
the captain through a speaking trumpet.
&ldquo;Sheer off, or I&rsquo;ll sink ev&rsquo;ry soul of ye within
gun-range.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down wid the darty furreners!&rdquo; screamed
King Teddy O&rsquo;Riley; a shower of balls whistled
past the captain, and on came the over-loaded
boats, with their crews yelling in the most
frantic manner. There appeared to be at least
five or six hundred of them, and it was judged
expedient to put an immediate stop to their
progress. The long gun was discharged, which
sunk the foremost boat, and killed the greater
portion of its crew. The rest hesitated when
they beheld their monarch swept into the sea;
and a well-directed fire of musketry made them
glad enough to commence a retreat as fast as
they could, screaming in hideous chorus as long as
they could be heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a boat and see if you can save any
of those rascals sprawling in the water,&rdquo; exclaimed
the captain to the midshipman Loop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; was the reply; and the boat
having been lowered, a party proceeded to pick
up the wounded and drowning. They succeeded
in saving several, among whom was
their illustrious leader, King Teddy O&rsquo;Riley,
who was brought upon deck, looking very
much deprived of his dignity, his coronet of
hay-bands wet and dirty, and his blanket of
state shrunk out of all shape. He created
considerable surprise among his captors, and
not without sufficient cause, for nothing could
exceed the eccentricity of his appearance.
His hair was thick and long, and of a dark-red
colour. Large, bushy whiskers of the same
tint surrounded his cheeks. His nose was
remarkably red, and his face seamed with the
marks of the small-pox. Below his cloak was
a long coat, which did not appear the more
royal for being out at the elbows, and for
having lost half its skirt. His lower garments
hung upon him like a bag, and they had the
legs rolled back up to the knees. A pair of
old boots, exceedingly down at heel, out of
which the toes of his majesty were seen to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
peep in spite of the straw with which they
were lined, completed his costume.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who the deuce are you?&rdquo; demanded
the captain, after he had sufficiently scrutinised
the appearance of his prisoner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faix and isn&rsquo;t it King Teddy O&rsquo;Riley I
am?&rdquo; replied the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what part o&rsquo; the world are you king
of, I should like to know?&rdquo; asked Hearty in
considerable surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faix and ain&rsquo;t I king ov Blatherumskite?&rdquo;
said the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where, in the name o&rsquo; all that&rsquo;s
wonderful, is Blatherumskite?&rdquo; inquired the
captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is it yourself that doesn&rsquo;t know where
Blatherumskite is?&rdquo; exclaimed his majesty in
seeming wonder. &ldquo;Well the ignorance o&rsquo; some
people is amazin! Not know Blatherumskite!
Be the holy japers that bates Bannagher, and
Bannagher bate the divle. And Blatherumskite
sich a jewel ov a place! Why Blatherumskite&rsquo;s
the finest kingdom and has the finest
paple under the sun. It&rsquo;s full ov commodities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
ov all sorts. It dales in turpentine, brickdust,
soft soap, and other swate mates&mdash;tracle, and
train oil, pepper and salt, and other hardware,&mdash;pigs,
buttermilk, paraties, and other kumbustibles.
Not know Blatherumskite indade! Be
this and be that, you&rsquo;re as ignorant as a born
brute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what induced you to fire at me, Mr.
King Teddy O&rsquo;Riley?&rdquo; demanded the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faix and wasn&rsquo;t it only just to kill ye we
fired at ye?&rdquo; replied the king, with the utmost
simplicity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was, was it?&rdquo; exclaimed Hearty; &ldquo;and
for what reason did you attack the ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wid no other rason in life than to take it,&rdquo;
responded his majesty. &ldquo;I was jist a lading the
boys to make a decint on England, wid the hope
ov being able to pick up a few thrifles, when we
seed your ship. &lsquo;The top ov the morning to
ye,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and if I don&rsquo;t be afther ransacking
ye intirely small blame to me there&rsquo;ll be.&rsquo; And
then we pulled away at the divle&rsquo;s own rate,
and a mighty dale ov divarsion the boys had
about what they&rsquo;d do wid the big ship when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
they&rsquo;d got her, when widout wid your lave or
by your lave, I was regularly kilt, smashed,
and smothered into the wather. And here
I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, King Teddy O&rsquo;Riley, we must be
under the necessity of hanging you,&rdquo; observed
the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang me!&rdquo; shouted the man, in perfect
amazement. &ldquo;Hang a king!&mdash;hang King Teddy
O&rsquo;Riley? Hang the King ov Blatherumskite?
Why its rank trason? Ye&rsquo;ll not be afther
thinkin ov doin sich a rebellious action. I
shall feel obliged to ye if ye wont mintion it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what would you have done with us if
you had succeeded in your ridiculous idea of
taking the ship?&rdquo; inquired Hearty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faix and wouldn&rsquo;t we have kilt every sowl
of yese, and taken the rest prisoners?&rdquo; replied
his majesty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we cannot do better than follow your
example,&rdquo; observed the captain; then turning
to some of his men, who appeared to enjoy the
scene with particular satisfaction, he exclaimed,
&ldquo;Get a rope ready at the fore-yard arm that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
may hang this fellow!&rdquo; The sailors with great
alacrity made the necessary preparations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be all the holy saints betwixt this and no
where, ye&rsquo;ll not be afther taking away the life
ov a poor king!&rdquo; exclaimed his majesty of Blatherumskite,
with the greatest earnestness and
alarm. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll I do now? Sure and I&rsquo;m
in a bad way! Sure and I&rsquo;ll be done for
intirely! And is it to be hanged I am?&rdquo; continued
he, looking woefully at the rope that
was dangling ready for immediate use. &ldquo;Is
King Teddy O&rsquo;Riley to be kilt afther sich a
villainous fashion? Oh what a disgrace for
Blatherumskite! What a dishonour to a king.
Oh what &rsquo;ill I do&mdash;what &rsquo;ill I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the rope ready?&rdquo; inquired Hearty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Sir,&rdquo; said the boatswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then hoist him up,&rdquo; replied the captain.
The men proceeded to fulfil the command of
their officer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s in a pretty way I am!&rdquo; exclaimed
the unfortunate monarch, with tears in his
eyes. &ldquo;Be the holy japers, wouldn&rsquo;t I change
places wid any body as would like to be hanged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in my place. It&rsquo;s yourself, Murphy O&rsquo;Blarney,
that&rsquo;s the good subject,&rdquo; said the king, addressing
one of his companions with particular
and impressive emphasis. &ldquo;Sure, and ye&rsquo;ve
got more pathriotism than to let the King ov
Blatherumskite be hanged, when it&rsquo;s your
own loyal neck as would fit the rope so azy.&rdquo;
Murphy O&rsquo;Blarney did not seem to hear.
&ldquo;Bad luck to the likes ov yese for a thraitor,&rdquo;
murmured his majesty. Then, turning to
another of his subjects, he said, &ldquo;Larry
Brogues, it&rsquo;s great confidence I place in ye&mdash;ye&rsquo;re
a jewel ov a man intirely; and if ye &rsquo;ill
jist be afther doing me the thrifling favour ov
being hanged in my place, the best pig I have
shall be your&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Larry appeared as if he had
lost all relish for pork. &ldquo;I always said ye
were a base ribbel!&rdquo; muttered the angry monarch,
turning from him to address a third.
&ldquo;Mick Killarney, a sinsible boy you&rsquo;ve
showed yerself afore to-day, and little&rsquo;s the
praise I take to meself for not having rewarded
ye according to your desarts; but if ye&rsquo;ll show
your superior desarnment, by letting the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
bit ov a rope be placed round your neck instead
ov mine, it&rsquo;s meself that &rsquo;ill make a man ov ye
when I get back to Blatherumskite.&rdquo; Mick
Killarney turned the only eye he had in his
head, to another part of the ship. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
more brains in the tail of a dead pig, than &rsquo;ill
ever come out ov yer thick skull, ye villain!&rdquo;
exclaimed King Teddy O&rsquo;Riley in a thundering
rage: then he looked very pathetic, wiped his
eyes with a corner of his blanket, and began to
chant, in the most miserable tones, the following
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>Oriel Porphyry, who had laughed exceedingly
at the whole scene, now stepped forward, and,
by his interference, saved his majesty&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always thought that Ireland formed a
portion of the British dominions,&rdquo; observed the
young merchant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So it did,&rdquo; replied Fortyfolios, &ldquo;and enjoyed
an unexampled state of prosperity; but
the people were always dissatisfied and unreasonable;
and were ever accusing the government
of the country by which they were ruled
of creating that social disorganisation which
was the effect of their own evil habits&mdash;and
which had existed, as may be proved by a reference
to their own annals, as far back as it
was possible to refer&mdash;and, upon the first opportunity,
they threw off their allegiance to the
British empire, and became, as they had previously
been, a separate kingdom. As might
have been expected, internal strife now appeared.
As had formerly been the case, the
country was cut up into a party of petty monarchies,
that were continually at war with
each other. These having gradually become
smaller and more numerous, there is now a
king to every potato-garden, of which class of
monarchs his majesty of Blatherumskite is an
example; and when these fellows are not
striving to exterminate each other, they make
piratical excursions to the neighbouring coast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and there create all the mischief in their power,
by robbing, plundering, killing, and burning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are entering the Nore, now Sir,&rdquo; remarked
the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The derivation of the word is exceedingly
puzzling,&rdquo; remarked the professor, &ldquo;and I
have met with no explanation that has satisfied
me. Some antiquarians trace it to Noah, but
they bring forward nothing which can be relied
on in proof of this idea. I must say it is my
opinion that Noah was never in this part of
the world. Others ascribe it to the frequent
use of the words &lsquo;Know her,&rsquo;&mdash;as parties of
pleasure used frequently to start in steam-boats
from the metropolis to this place, and then
return; and intimacies between the young
males and the young females who had never
met previously, used to spring up during this
excursion, and the former used to reply when
they were asked if they knew an individual of
the other sex, &lsquo;Know her? we met going
towards the sea,&rsquo; and the words at last became
so common that it gave name to the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong again, don&rsquo;t you see!&rdquo; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the doctor. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you how
the place came by the name. In very ancient
times a company of individuals created a joint-stock
association to work a copper mine of
great value which they said had been discovered
on the neighbouring coast, and the people,
deluded by the great anticipations held out by
the schemers, invested large sums in the affair.
The shaft was sunk and the mine worked, and
the anxious citizens were every day coming
down in crowds to learn the progress of the
mine, but they invariably met with one answer
to all their queries, which was &lsquo;No Ore;&rsquo; and
this lasted till the bubble burst. Since then
the place was called &lsquo;No Ore,&rsquo; which ultimately
dwindled into &lsquo;Nore.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Preposterous!&rdquo; cried Fortyfolios. &ldquo;I
wonder you can repeat such a ridiculous conception.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m positive that my &lsquo;No ore&rsquo; is as good
as your &lsquo;Noah&rsquo; or &lsquo;Know her,&rsquo; don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo;
replied the doctor, good humouredly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind, Dr. Tourniquet,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the other very gravely. &ldquo;My derivations are
founded on well ascertained facts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And my derivation is founded on better
ascertained facts,&rdquo; added the surgeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The coast here seems quite deserted,&rdquo;
observed Oriel Porphyry. &ldquo;I do not see a
habitation&mdash;nor a human creature&mdash;nor any
species of vessel&mdash;nor any sign of life whatever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly the natives have deserted this
part of the coast from its liability to be visited
by the Irish pirates,&rdquo; replied the professor.
&ldquo;But what a change there must have been in
the appearance of this neighbourhood a few
centuries back! Then vessels of every size and
nation might have been seen sailing in almost
countless numbers down the river to the Port
of London, which was the mart of the world.
Merchant ships and ships of war, colliers,
fishing-vessels, passage-boats and pleasure-yachts
were passing and re-passing each other
at all hours of the day. Then these masses of
ruins which you are passing on each side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
river, were filled with busy inhabitants engaged
in the various labours of traffic. Here ships
were built, fitted out, victualled, and stored,
and when manned with a gallant crew, set
sail to visit every quarter of the globe, to
dispose of their cargoes and to bring home the
produce of other countries. There was a battery
to prevent the passage of the enemy&rsquo;s
ships in time of war. A little further on we
come to a fashionable watering place, in which
the tired citizens forgot the toils of business in
the pursuit of pleasure. Towns and villages
existed on either side; some of considerable
importance, with a numerous population engaged
in every species of manufacture and of
laborious employment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The country possesses a most desolate
appearance,&rdquo; remarked Zabra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The natural effect of the cause which produced
it,&rdquo; responded the professor. &ldquo;Here
all the horrors of war have been exhibited on
the most comprehensive scale, and what warfare
left untouched time has since destroyed.
Nothing meets the eye but blackened buildings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and tottering walls. The country is a wilderness&mdash;the
town a desert. A little time since
all was busy&mdash;all was fertile; and every nook
and corner resounded with the stir of the artisan
at his craft, and the mirth of the idler at his
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What part of the island was this called?&rdquo;
inquired Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are the shores of Kent, so called
from the ancient word Kenned, known or
famous,&rdquo; replied Fortyfolios. &ldquo;It was called
the garden of England, and, if the accounts
which describe it are to be depended on, well
did it deserve the title. It was one continued
field of fruit, and flowers, and grain. Forests
of magnificent timber afforded materials for the
carpenter and the ship-builder&mdash;plantations of
hops gave employment to the cultivators, the
merchants, and the brewers of malt liquors;
and orchards of cherries were in constant
demand from one end of the island to the other.
Now the timber has either been cut down, or
died of natural decay&mdash;the hop gardens have
given place to crops of luxuriant weeds&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the sweet and luscious fruits have become wild
and sour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is an extensive collection of ruins on
the left&mdash;and it seems once to have been an
important place,&rdquo; observed the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was so,&rdquo; said the professor. &ldquo;There
were the public dockyards, the arsenal, a college
for the education of youth to the profession
of war, manufactures on the most extensive
scale of materials employed in fitting out ships
for the war or merchant service, and conveniences
for traffic or accumulation of all sorts
of naval and military stores. There were foundries
for cannon&mdash;manufactories of cordage,
shot, nails, and ship biscuit&mdash;magazines for
the safe deposit of gunpowder&mdash;yards for ship-building,
and warehouses for apparel: now you
see nothing but the bare walls rising up from
the mass of ruins of which they are a portion.
In solitude the wild dog howls where all was
human life and industry; and with the boldness
of long indulgence, the bats congregate in the
chambers of the merchants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are the remains of a more stately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
structure than any we have hitherto passed&mdash;was
it a palace?&rdquo; inquired Oriel Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was nothing more than a hospital for
poor sailors, such as had been maimed in the
service of their country,&rdquo; replied Fortyfolios.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed the young merchant,
with considerable surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing else, I assure you,&rdquo; added his tutor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The government were remarkably attentive
to the wants of their seamen then&mdash;they must
have valued their services very high to have
lodged them in so sumptuous a building as this
appears to have been,&rdquo; observed Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their dwelling was at one time far more
magnificent than the palace of the King of
England,&rdquo; continued the professor. &ldquo;There
was no edifice erected for such a purpose to
equal it in the whole world. There the wounded
sailor passed the rest of his life enjoying
every comfort he required. He had the range
of a magnificent mansion, and an extensive and
beautiful park. Proper officers watched over
his health, his diet was strengthening and plentiful,
and under the care of good and pious men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
his moral wants were equally well attended to.
In another part of the river there used to be a
building of similar extent that had been erected
for poor and wounded soldiers, and they were
provided for in a manner equally generous and
considerate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These people were distinguished for their
charities, I believe,&rdquo; remarked the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were,&rdquo; replied Fortyfolios. &ldquo;They
had numberless hospitals in which the poor,
afflicted with disease, or hurt by accidents,
were promptly cared for, and skilfully treated.
The ablest physicians, the most experienced
surgeons, and the most skilful nurses waited
upon them; and all that the necessities of their
cases demanded was immediately rendered.
They had asylums for females who had strayed
from the path of virtue, where they were taught
industrious and moral habits, and then restored
to society capable of taking a place with its
most useful and honourable members. They
had houses of instruction to reclaim young
thieves, in which they received an excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
education, were taught some useful trade, and
then re-entered the community capable of passing
through the busy scenes of life with credit
to themselves and others. They had&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They had hospitals and asylums for every
vice that disgraces humanity, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo;
said the doctor, interrupting the speaker with
more bitterness than was usual with him.
&ldquo;The vilest of the vile were sheltered and
preached to, and made comfortable and happy;
but while vice received every possible attention
in fine buildings, with numerous servants,
virtue might crawl through the public streets
and starve; and while the rogue was carefully
instructed in all things that were excellent to
save his wretched life and soul, the honest man,
struggling with adversity and sickness, was left
to die and be damned. There was no asylum
for the virtuous woman; but the vilest prostitute
had always a ready home. Integrity and
intelligence had to fight with famine alone and
unnoticed; but ignorance and dishonesty, profligacy
and crime, were sought after and generously
provided for. In fact, under this miserable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
state of things there existed a bonus upon vice.
If the vile were only vile enough, they were the
objects of universal benevolence: but to be poor
without being vile&mdash;oh! it was considered something
so contemptible, that the charitable could
not be brought to pay it the slightest regard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a wonder Fortyfolios made no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This place is also of considerable importance
to the scientific inquirer,&rdquo; continued the professor;
&ldquo;for here was a famous observatory, in
which the most illustrious astronomers carried
on their investigations into the motions of the
heavenly bodies, and the laws which govern
them. Many interesting discoveries were here
made. From here were calculated the distances
of various parts of the world. The neighbourhood
was also distinguished by being a place of
favorite resort of the inhabitants of the metropolis;
and even members of the government
used to indulge themselves occasionally with a
trip to this once delightful place, for the purpose
of enjoying a delicacy in the shape of a very
small fish, a thousand of which would scarcely
make a sufficient meal.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are many heaps of stones and fragments
of brickwork. I should suppose that
they are the remains of a town of some kind,&rdquo;
observed the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They cover a space sufficiently extensive
to make it probable,&rdquo; replied Fortyfolios; &ldquo;but
they ought to be considered as a distant suburb
of the metropolis. They were chiefly inhabited
by persons engaged in the production or sale of
naval stores, and boat-builders, fishermen, and
sailors employed in managing the craft upon
the river. In some places there are wharves
for merchandise, in others for coals; here was a
factory for the produce of canvass, there an
establishment of engineers who sent steam
vessels to every sea that flows. The river here
used to be crowded with shipping; so much
so that the passage of the vessels often became
slow and dangerous. Here were ships from
every commercial nation on the globe, each
laden with the produce of their country, and
each intent on returning with a cargo of
English goods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a gloomy looking building this must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
have been, if we may judge from what remains
of it!&rdquo; remarked Zabra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That used to be a fortress and state prison,&rdquo;
said the Professor. &ldquo;There were once confined
persons accused of treason, and there they remained
previous to their execution. Some of
the noblest and best spirits of the time have
been incarcerated in those old walls. The noble
Raleigh, the patriot Russell, the lovely Anna
Boleyn, and numberless others whose names
have become a part of history. There also
were kept the regalia and&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there also were kept the wild beasts,&rdquo;
observed the doctor, good humouredly, &ldquo;and
there is every reason for believing that the latter
managed to get at the regalia; for an ancient
poem I have met with says&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;The lion and the unicorn<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were fighting for the crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lion beat the unicorn<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">no doubt to the great astonishment of the
citizens.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to anchor now, sir,&rdquo; here exclaimed
the captain, &ldquo;as the navigation o&rsquo; the
river beyond this arn&rsquo;t practicable for a vessel
o&rsquo; such tonnage as the Albatross.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it be done then,&rdquo; replied the young
merchant; &ldquo;and let an armed party be got
ready to accompany me on land, as I am desirous
of examining the antiquities of the
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; responded Hearty; and preparations
were immediately made to go ashore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see before you the remains of a
bridge,&rdquo; observed Fortyfolios, pointing to several
broken arches that appeared above the
water; &ldquo;it was considered one of the finest
examples of that kind of structure that had
ever been erected, and an old chronicler I
lately perused gives an elaborate account of the
ceremonies that took place when it was first
opened to the public. On that occasion the
king and queen went in state, accompanied by
their court, and all the great men were there,
and the great merchants, and thousands upon
thousands of citizens. Now you can behold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
nothing but the crumbling stone-work, green
with age, and instead of the music and shouts
which accompanied the procession, we can only
hear the hoarse cry of the bittern from the
neighbouring marshes, and the fierce howl of
the jackal from some ruined building.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boat&rsquo;s ready, sir!&rdquo; said the captain;
and shortly afterwards the whole party proceeded
in a boat to the shore.</p>

<br />
<span class="f8">THE LAST OF THE ENGLISHMEN.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">A large</span> tent had been pitched in an open
space among the ruins of the ancient city.
Before it stood Oriel Porphyry leaning on a
gun, with Zabra at his side, resting on his harp.
At the distance of a few feet Fortyfolios and
Tourniquet were seated on a fallen pillar, disputing
about the character of a building, the
remains of which lay before them. The captain
and the midshipman were conversing together
by the side of the tent, and grouped about were
twenty or thirty sailors well armed&mdash;some
reclining on the ground, others leaning against
a column, and the rest congregated into little
parties, engaged in talking over the adventures
of the day, or in passing their opinions upon
the neighbouring ruins.</p>

<p>On one side of the tent stood a great portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of a very elegant structure, of considerable
dimensions, and of a classical style of architecture;
on the other side stood the ruins of a
building of about the same size, with a handsome
portico supported by several beautiful
pillars, upon which might be observed a female
draperied figure much mutilated. A short distance
from between them there arose a tall
column with a bronze statue of a warrior,
broken and disfigured, lying at its base. Beyond
the column was a flight of broken steps
that led to an open space overgrown with wild
shrubs and weeds; and beyond these, and around
in every direction, nothing met the eye but confused
heaps of stone and brickwork, overgrown
with rank herbage; and pillars, and walls, and
glassless windows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am tired of this continual ruin,&rdquo; exclaimed
Oriel Porphyry. &ldquo;We have travelled all the
day and met nothing but broken pedestals,
and prostrate capitals; porches without pillars,
and pillars without porches; trembling porticoes,
tottering walls, and roofless dwellings.
I never witnessed such a perfect desolation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
The only living thing I have seen was a wolf,
who stared at me as if quite unused to a human
countenance, and never attempted to move till
I sent the contents of my gun at his head.
Then, immediately I had fired, there flew
around me such flights of bats, ravens, vultures,
and owls, and they created such a din of screaming
and hooting, that I was absolutely startled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See how the ivy clings to the wall, Oriel!&rdquo;
said Zabra to his patron, as he pointed to a ruin
beside them; &ldquo;how it twines round the fluted
pillar, and hides the ornaments of the richly
decorated capital. There is poetry astir in
those leaves&mdash;there is a music breathing in the
breeze that shakes them. There! see you the
bird moving out its head from their friendly
shelter to notice our movements? She has her
nest there, Oriel: in that little circle are all
her pleasures concentrated. She has made her
happiness in the very desolation of which you
complain. It is impossible to look around and
say all is barren. There is not a weed that
grows but what is full of enjoyment for myriads
of creatures of which we take no note. Is there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
nothing in these stones which does not awaken
in you associations that ought to people them
with the countless multitudes that once found
pleasure in this wilderness? I see not the ruin.
I notice not the silence. Memory looks through
the vista of departed time, and lo! all is splendour
and beauty&mdash;and the deserted porticoes
echo with the voice of gladness. Let me sing
to you, Oriel; this is a glorious place for sweet
sounds and antique memories, and I will see to
what use I can apply them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young musician, after a short, touching
prelude, then sung, with the deep expression
that characterised all his attempts at minstrelsy,
the following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;To the home of the brave ones, the true and the kind,<br /></span>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Dr. Tourniquet, you&rsquo;re completely
in error,&rdquo; exclaimed Fortyfolios. &ldquo;The
meaning of the word United Service is evident,
and admits of no dispute. In old authors we
frequently read of people &lsquo;going to service,&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and as often of a union of offices in the same
person, such as butler and steward, valet and
footman, gardener and groom; and there cannot
be a doubt that this is what was called united
service, and that this building was dedicated to
the purpose of finding situations for such
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dedicated to a fiddle-stick. Don&rsquo;t you
see?&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;I tell you it was a
club that met there to play at cards, and that was
the reason that they had a king of clubs, and a
queen of clubs, and a knave of clubs, and ever
so many other clubs; and as a qualification, all
the members were obliged to be club-footed,
and they were governed by what they called
club law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T was no such thing, Dr. Tourniquet,
depend upon it,&rdquo; said the professor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure &rsquo;t was the united service, because I have a
book in my library that mentions it as the
United Service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure it was a club, because I&rsquo;ve
got a book in my library that mentions it as a
club,&rdquo; responded the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the building opposite was devoted to
very different purposes,&rdquo; continued Fortyfolios.
&ldquo;It was called the Athenæum, the derivation
of which word I have never been able to
discover. Perhaps it had its origin in the
Modern Athens, a place of some importance in
the neighbourhood of Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine&mdash;once
a famous depôt for combustibles, that blew
up occasionally with great damage. However,
it was erected for the purpose of bringing
together all the intelligence of the country.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Together let us range the fields,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Impearled with the morning dew,&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">says an ancient poet, and there is no doubt
that the lines were addressed by one member
of the Athenæum to another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what good did they ever do by being
brought together?&rdquo; inquired Tourniquet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That has never been ascertained,&rdquo; replied
the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For what purpose was this column erected?&rdquo;
asked the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was erected to commemorate the victories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of a certain Duke of York,&rdquo; said the
professor. &ldquo;He distinguished himself greatly
during the wars of the rival houses of York
and Lancaster. Besides being a great general,
his piety was so great that he became a bishop,
and there are a series of moral discourses
extant, that took place between the Bishop and
the Bishop&rsquo;s Clarke, a person who was also
very celebrated. It may be said that this
Duke of York enjoyed more credit in his day
than any of his predecessors; indeed he was in
such general requisition that the constant inquiries
after him, gave rise to the saying, &lsquo;York,
you&rsquo;re wanted;&rsquo; and it was to him that the
people, after a disturbance which he had pacified,
said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&lsquo;Now is the winter of our discontent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made glorious summer by the son of York.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly feel the charm of association
as much as any one,&rdquo; observed Oriel to his
companion; &ldquo;but the gratification I find in
treading shores so celebrated by historic recollections
is changed to a painful feeling at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
beholding the wreck to which has been reduced
the greatness I have honoured. I should suppose,
from what I have seen, that the whole
land is in a similar state as that portion of it
which has come under my observation. I can
imagine nothing so deplorable. There appear
to be no living things in the island but wild
animals. I can only account for their being
here, from my knowledge that, in former times,
the natives kept several large collections of
them for show, and that these having escaped,
they spread themselves over the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment Oriel&rsquo;s quick ear caught the
sound of a low sharp growl at no great distance
from him, and turning round, beheld a large
lion crouching behind a heap of stones near the
two philosophers, who were disputing so vehemently
that they had not the slightest idea
of their danger. The young merchant had
just time to get his gun in readiness and give
the alarm to the sailors, when, with a fierce
roar that came like a peal of thunder upon the
terrified disputants, the lion sprung upon them,
and knocked them both down. He stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
majestically with one paw upon the prostrate
philosophers, looking defiance on Oriel and his
companions, as they cautiously approached him
from all sides with their muskets in their
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my friends,&rdquo; exclaimed the young
merchant, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t fire till you come within
good aiming distance&mdash;don&rsquo;t more than half
fire at a time&mdash;let the others reserve their fire,
in case he makes a spring&mdash;be steady, and aim
at his head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir,&rdquo; was murmured by the captain;
and every man held his breath, cocked
his gun, picked his way carefully over the
stones, and prepared himself for a struggle with
his dangerous enemy. The lion saw them advancing&mdash;shook
his mane, lashed his tail, and,
bending his head to the ground, uttered a long
and deafening roar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then, mind your aim,&rdquo; said the young
merchant. About a dozen discharged their
pieces; and, with a piercing howl, the lion
dashed among his foes, knocking down some
half-a-dozen of them, and scattering the rest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
all directions. Luckily, he had been too severely
wounded to do any more serious mischief.
His roar was terrible; but the men
having again approached him, poured in a
more deadly fire, and with a vain attempt to
reach them, he gave a savage growl, and fell
covered with wounds. Scarcely had this been
done, before a distant roar was heard by the
victors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make haste and reload, for, if I mistake
not, we shall have the lioness upon us in a few
seconds,&rdquo; said Oriel Porphyry earnestly; and
all quickened their preparations, to be in readiness
for another contest. &ldquo;Take up a position
behind that ruin, for the lioness will first make
to the dead lion, and then she will attempt to
turn her rage upon us. We shall have her
within gun range as soon as she comes to the
lion, and shall be in some sort of shelter when
she begins her attack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scarcely had the position been taken and the
arrangements made, when the roar became
more distinct; and, soon afterwards, the lioness
was seen rapidly approaching, with a series of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
prodigious leaps that quickly brought her into
the immediate neighbourhood of the party in
ambush. She instantly proceeded to the lion.
At first, she patted him with her paw. Finding
he took no notice of that, she fawned upon him,
and licked him with her tongue, playfully bit
his ear, and played with his mane. Observing
that he was still inattentive to her movements,
she gently turned him over; and then, noticing
the wounds in his head and body, and his incapability
of replying to her caresses, she uttered
a roar so loud and piercing, that it made the
old walls about her echo again. This was replied
to by a peal of musketry from the neighbouring
ruin. In a moment, with another
deafening howl, she rushed towards the place
whence came the reports, and with one desperate
bound, leaped to the window behind
which Oriel and his companions lay concealed
upon a heap of stones and rubbish. She had
got her fore paws and head upon the ledge of
the window, when another shower of balls sent
her reeling back. Howling with rage she
made the leap again; when a blow on the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
from the butt end of a gun, held by a stout
seaman, made her loosen her hold, and, with a
savage growl, she fell to the ground. From
there she next crawled to the body of the lion,
licking the upper part of his body, and uttering
the most wild and melancholy howls. She was
evidently much wounded; but she managed
to crawl round him several times, drawing her
long tongue over his mane, and moving a paw,
or his head, in hopes of noticing some sign of
recognition. At last, finding all her efforts
ineffectual, she emitted a roar that rivalled the
loudest thunder, lashed her body furiously with
her tail, began tearing up the stones and soil
around her, and then, as if putting forth her
strength for a last effort, she made two or three
prodigious leaps towards the adjoining building.
The bullets that met her in her way did not
stop her progress, for with one enormous
bound she cleared the window, and came
down in the midst of the voyagers, dashing
them about with a violence that gave several of
the men very severe contusions, and grasping
one by the neck so furiously that he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
have inevitably been killed, had not Loop
stabbed her to the heart with a short sword he
carried, while Hearty gave her a desperate
blow on the head with an immense fragment of
stone. Letting go the man she had got so
firmly in her grasp, she turned upon her assailants
a look of the most savage ferocity, and
then, with a short howl of agony, fell back
dead at their feet.</p>

<p>They had dragged the lioness out of the
building, and several of the men were busily
engaged taking off the skins of the two animals,
and the rest were talking over the dangers they
had escaped, when Zabra pointed out to his
patron the figures of an old man and a young
female, who were advancing up the broken steps
that led to the base of the column. The sight
of human beings was so novel, that every one
paid particular attention to the individuals they
now beheld. The man appeared to have reached
extreme old age, for his hair was white and
long, and hung down upon his neck and
shoulders. His complexion was ruddy, but
although the face was covered with wrinkles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and deeply marked furrows, there was an animation
in his eyes that showed that the fire of
life was still brilliantly burning. He was tall,
and walked firmly, supporting himself by a long
staff. The skin of a lion hung from his neck
over his manly shoulders. The rest of his
dress was composed of skins fastened by thongs
round his body and legs. A long sword was
suspended at his side, which, with a knife or
dagger at his waist, seemed all the weapons he
possessed.</p>

<p>He was accompanied by a young girl, whose
complexion had evidently been browned by
exposure to the sun, the effect of which gave
a warmer character to the quiet beauty of her
features. Her eyes were of a soft, deep, blue,
beaming with tenderness and benevolence; and
her hair, which was silken in its texture, and
very light in colour, fell in clustering curls from
her forehead to her neck. A sort of cape, made
of feathers, covered her shoulders; beneath
which was a long garment reaching below the
knees, made of different skins neatly sewed together,
and bound round the waist with a belt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of the same. Her arms and legs were bare,
and they were of the most exquisite symmetry,
delicately and beautifully formed. In one hand
she carried a light spear, and the other she
rested upon the shoulder of her companion.</p>

<p>As soon as the young girl observed the voyagers,
she started back with an exclamation of
fear, and clung to the arm of her elder companion,
who, noticing the cause of her alarm,
immediately let fall his staff and drew his sword.
There was something remarkably imposing in
the attitude of the old man. He drew up his
stately form to its full height; and as he stood
upon the defensive with his weapon firmly
grasped in his right hand, while with his left
arm he clasped the young girl by the waist and
drew her behind him, there seemed a vigour in
his silvery hairs, and a fire in his sunken eyes,
that neither youth or manhood could have
rivalled.</p>

<p>Oriel Porphyry, who looked upon them with
peculiar interest, laid down his arms and
advanced towards them, accompanied only
by Zabra, who was also unarmed. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
approaches were closely regarded by the man,
and watched with curiosity by the female.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fear us not, old man, we will do you no
harm,&rdquo; said the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fear!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man proudly,
&ldquo;I know it not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are voyagers from a distant land, who
have been induced to visit your shores, from a
desire to do honour to a country once so
famous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man, without making any reply,
hastily returned his sword to its scabbard, and
then, with a countenance in which fearlessness
and kindness were blended, held out his right
hand. The hand of Oriel Porphyry was soon
in its cordial and friendly grasp, and a compact
of sociality seemed immediately agreed to
between both parties. &ldquo;And you, fair maid,
need not be alarmed,&rdquo; said Zabra, approaching
the maiden with a look that might have inspired
a savage with confidence. &ldquo;You will
meet amongst us none but friends anxious to
do you honour and service.&rdquo; She shrunk back
from his advances with a strong feeling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
timidity expressed in her features; yet continued
to gaze on the handsome face and
graceful person of the speaker, as if they had
for her an attraction impossible to be resisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The child is unused to strangers,&rdquo; observed
her companion, as he noticed the shy and wondering
manner with which she regarded Zabra.
&ldquo;It is long since she has seen a human being
except myself. Be not afraid, Lilya,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
as he drew her towards him. &ldquo;These
are not enemies. They are wanderers, like
ourselves; but they have a home and kindred&mdash;we
have neither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cheerful countenance of the old man
now became clouded with melancholy, and he
sighed as if there was a heaviness upon his
heart that could not be removed; but the timid
Lilya still gazed upon the features of the young
musician, as if she found it impossible to remove
her eyes from their beauty. There was an
extraordinary contrast between her and her
companion. She seemed just in the dawn of
womanhood, with delicate limbs, and looks all
bashfulness and pleased surprise; while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
appeared on the extreme verge of old age&mdash;all
bone and sinews, hard and rough with exposure
to the severities of time and climate.
She was evidently too young to be his daughter;
but that there was some relationship between
them was evident, for even in the gentle loveliness
that distinguished her youthful face
might be discerned faint traces of resemblance
to the ancient but noble example of manhood
that stood by her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your appearance has much interested
me,&rdquo; said the young merchant, gazing on the
stranger&rsquo;s venerable appearance with affectionate
respect; &ldquo;and I hope it will not be
deemed intrusive or impertinent if I inquire
who it is I behold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see before you the last of the Englishmen,&rdquo;
said the old man, looking proudly
upon the inquirer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel, regarding
him with increased admiration and a voluntary
feeling of homage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last of that powerful and illustrious
race is now before you,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
is the child of my child&rsquo;s child. We are all
that remain of the great people who filled this
island with their multitudes and the world with
their fame. Kindred and countrymen&mdash;all are
gone; their homes are the habitations of the
wild cat and the vulture, and even their very
graves have been made desolate by the jackal
and the hyena.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You appear to have attained a great age,&rdquo;
remarked Zabra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! I have outlived my country,&rdquo; replied
the Englishman. &ldquo;A hundred and
twenty years have passed since my existence
commenced. Time has forgotten me. I have
been where the sword was ploughing deep
furrows around me far and near.&mdash;I have seen
Death busy at his work amid the youthful, the
old, the innocent and the guilty.&mdash;I have noticed
the young trees grow up, put forth their
bravery, and die.&mdash;I have beheld mighty buildings
crumble into dust.&mdash;I have known all
things perish before my eyes: yet I have
remained untouched in the midst of the desolation.&mdash;Three
generations have passed away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and have left me to gather consolation from
their tombs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the relation of what you have known
and endured be not too painful, I should much
like to hear it,&rdquo; said the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have the patience to listen, all shall
be told to you,&rdquo; replied the old man. Then
taking up his staff, he walked on to some
fragments of building that lay at a short distance,
on which he sat with Lilya at his feet.
Oriel Porphyry, Zabra, Loop, the captain,
Fortyfolios, and the doctor sat or reclined in a
circle round him, and beyond the circle, the
sailors stood leaning on their guns.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_V" id="CHAP_V">CHAP. V.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">AN ACCOUNT OF THE DECLINE AND FALL OF
OLD ENGLAND.</span></h2>


<p class="noi">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">It</span> must be at least a century since the necessities
of the kingdom obliged me, for the first
time, to attempt the trade of war,&rdquo; said the
Englishman. &ldquo;There had been some dispute
between the government and the people, which
was originally of little consequence, but the
zeal of furious partizans on each side gave it
an importance which would not otherwise have
belonged to it. One said the safety of the
people depended on their success&mdash;another
declared that the security of the crown was
involved in the question. One party were
frantic for liberty&mdash;another party, not so numerous,
but far more influential, were enthusiastic
for loyalty. But words were soon given
up for more effective weapons. The Court,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
proud in their strength, prepared themselves
for a sanguinary conflict; and their antagonists,
having equal confidence in their numbers,
followed their example with the same alacrity.
The whole country was astir with contention:
families were divided, and friends turned into
foes. He who opposed the King was denounced
as a rebel; and he who differed with the
people was declared a traitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many disturbances had broken out before
the parties took the field in military array;
but now the quarrel assumed a more serious
aspect. Every one armed himself, and hastened
to join that cause which seemed to him
the best; and the most influential men on each
side led these masses to the battle. Though
they were children of the same soil, and many
had relatives in the opposite ranks, nothing
could equal the animosity with which they
engaged and the fury with which they fought.
Never had they against a foreign foe exhibited
such fierceness. The battle raged nearly the
whole of the day with great slaughter on both
sides. The men of loyalty were less in number,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
but they were more experienced in soldiership.
The men of liberty had the most powerful army,
but they were deficient in military discipline
and in martial appearance. They fought with
the most determined courage, resisting and
making attacks, attacking and defending positions,
till, after a protracted struggle, the latter
succeeded in driving their opponents off the
field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was merely the commencement of
hostilities. The crown party, though defeated,
were very soon in a condition to renew the
contest; and though this victory to the popular
cause brought a great increase of strength, it
did not save its partizans from being defeated
with immense slaughter in the next battle that
was fought. For several years a destructive
civil war raged with unexampled ferocity in
every part of the kingdom; sometimes one
party being the strongest, sometimes the other.
Every individual capable of bearing arms was
obliged to join either the cause of the king or
that of the people; and, as a great diversity of
opinion existed, brothers were set against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
brothers, and fathers against sons, and thousands
and tens of thousands of the bravest of her
citizens daily were cast into pits to feed the
worms of the soil of England. At last the
popular cause triumphed, and the King became
a fugitive. Loud were the congratulations of
the victors when no doubt seemed to remain of
their success; but they had little cause for
their joy&mdash;they had only changed a bad ruler
for a worse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The triumphant party now sought out
such of their fellow-citizens who had most
distinguished themselves by their hostility to
their progress during the late warfare; and
they who did not succeed in escaping were
persecuted and exterminated in every way that
vengeance could devise. Blood continued to
flow, and hatred and strife still existed. The
leading men among them had scarcely settled
themselves in their authority, before they began
to differ concerning their notions of government.
Some were for one form and some for another,
and each had his own theory to support or his
own ambition to gratify. The difference soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
increased to open hostility; and as each was
supported by a numerous band of partizans,
each strove for the mastery with all the cunning
and boldness he possessed. Battles were
again fought&mdash;victims were again sacrificed.
Party succeeded party; and as one overpowered
the other, the vanquished were sure to be massacred
if they remained within the power of
their conquerors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the cause of the king was considered
the cause of all kings; and while the different
leaders of the people seemed intent only upon
exterminating each other, a powerful armament
was being fitted out in a neighbouring kingdom
for the purpose of restoring the deposed
monarch to his possessions. The first intimation
that the ruling government had of this
expedition was derived from its landing upon
the coast; and the necessity of an immediate
union between all parties against the common
enemy became so evident, that they lost no
time in settling their differences, joining their
disposable forces, and making preparations to
resist the approaches of their expelled sovereign.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Numbers, who had suffered from the
oppressions of the many, now hastened to the
king&rsquo;s standard. The loyal came from their
hiding places, and those who had fled to the
neighbouring continent hurried back again to
share in the struggle. The battle-cry of one
was, &lsquo;God and the King&rsquo;&mdash;that of the other,
&lsquo;God and the People;&rsquo; and, with increased
animosity, the contending armies rushed to the
conflict, till the whole country seemed flowing
with blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At first the king was successful in almost
every encounter with his rebellious subjects.
Battle after battle was fought, and still he kept
advancing and triumphing on his way. But
the leaders of the people did not despair. They
carried on the contest with the same spirit notwithstanding
their defeats. The whole population
rose in arms. No sooner was one army
dispersed than another was ready for action.
Three times the court party took possession of
the capital, and were again driven out. The
contest was prolonged by the military genius
of one man, whose mind seemed exhaustless in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
resources. He had risen from obscurity, and
had gradually exalted himself from one command
to another during the civil war, till the
whole forces on the side of the people were at
his disposal. Success appeared to attend all
his efforts. As he in his own person exhibited
the most determined bravery, his followers were
stimulated to copy his example. The most
daring attacks were planned and executed, and
the royalists began to lose all the advantages
they had previously gained. It was the intention
of the popular general to terminate the
contest at a blow; and with this object in
view he concentrated all his forces, and unexpectedly
brought them upon the enemy&rsquo;s camp.
The royalists were taken quite unprepared, and
few escaped to announce their defeat. The
king, the nobles, the foreign troops, and a great
portion of their native allies perished in one
indiscriminate slaughter; and thus the hopes of
the loyal were utterly annihilated for the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As every man was obliged to join one or
the other party, I had my share in these struggles
for mastery. I had inherited a small patrimony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
in one of the inland counties, and I had
recently married a young and beautiful relative,
to whom I had been attached from my youth,
when I was first called upon to contribute my
assistance towards bringing the contest to a
termination. I was an ardent lover of liberty.
I was a great advocate for republics, and I had
long looked upon kings as expensive and useless
machines, which the people could easily spare.
It may easily be imagined, from my acknowledgement
of these sentiments, that I eagerly embraced
the popular cause. I mixed myself up
as little as possible with the squabbles of
partizans; but there were few more sincere
adherents to the principles I professed than
myself. I was present at nearly all the great
engagements, received several wounds, and
gradually acquired rank and experience in
the republican army. My superior officers
respected me, and the men under my command
were attentive and obedient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the destruction of the royalists, the
people were so frantic in praise of their leader
that he thought he might be allowed to assume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the sovereign power. He did so, amid the
acclamations of the multitude; and in six
months after was assassinated. No sooner was
his decease known than there rose the same
intrigues for supremacy that his master mind
had quelled. Party succeeded party, and government
followed government, in rapid succession;
and the gibbet and the axe were in constant
requisition by whatever party happened
to be in power. As if it was determined that
this unhappy nation should enjoy no respite
from its troubles, the son of the late king,
assuming the royal dignity, had succeeded in
inducing a foreign power to grant such assistance
as might be required to reinstate him in
the throne of his fathers. He landed on the
English coast with a large army of foreigners,
and advanced in a very imposing manner
towards the ancient metropolis. The government
had no force sufficient to dispute his
progress, and fancying itself unable to struggle
successfully against the army brought against it,
it took the dangerous resolution of inviting to its
assistance the monarch of a neighbouring and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
powerful kingdom. While this was being done
the young king marched forward, meeting with
very little opposition till he came within a few
miles of the metropolitan city. There the leaders
of the people had taken up a strong position,
and although they were inferior to the royalists
in number and soldiership, and had not yet
received the expected succours from the foreign
power, they determined to dispute the passage
with the royalists. The battle was long and sanguinary.
The people, favoured by their position,
quietly awaited the attack of their opponents,
and as they advanced, poured into their ranks
a heavy and destructive fire; but although they
fought in the most steady and heroic manner,
the superiority of the enemy in numbers and
discipline was too great to be counteracted by
the most steady courage. The republicans
were driven from their position, and defeated
with great slaughter; after which the young
monarch marched into the ancient city, of which
he took possession. It was at first resolved to
renew the fight in the streets of the metropolis;
but dissension and ill-will arose in their councils,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and nothing being resolved on, the popular army
retreated from the city, leaving it open to the
advance of the royalists.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young king, fancying that all opposition
had ceased, or that the defeated party could not
now offer him any molestation, passed his time
in getting up the idle ceremonies of a coronation;
but the leaders of the people were preparing
to recommence the struggle. A powerful
army from the monarch who had promised them
assistance, had landed, and such good use did
they make of their time, that the young king
was obliged to leave the metropolis in the very
midst of his coronation. Then again the horrors
of civil war broke out with fresh fury.
As each party was assisted by foreign allies,
the war was never left to languish. Reinforcements
were continually being poured into the
kingdom, and the ranks of the opposing armies,
thus strengthened, were led against each other,
and fiercer and more relentless became the
strife. Blood flowed like water, and flesh was
cut down like grass. Villages were deserted&mdash;towns
burnt&mdash;cities depopulated. Whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
by design or accident is not known, but it was
found out that in all engagements the inhabitants
suffered infinitely more than their foreign
auxiliaries. At every battle the fields were
strewn with their dead, while the loss of their
allies was but trifling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the war had been protracted till
there scarcely seemed materials left in the
kingdom to continue it, the king&rsquo;s party were
completely annihilated, and the foreign troops
that had assisted them were glad to make their
escape out of the country. The allies which
the leaders of the people had called to their
assistance, had been gradually augmented until
they had become an exceedingly numerous and
powerful body, and when the war was over, it
was the anxious desire of the people to get
rid of them as soon as possible. But their
friends were not so easily to be disposed of.
On different pretexts they protracted their stay
till they had obtained possession of nearly all
the strong places in the empire, and then they
not only refused to depart, but commenced a
war of extermination on the people they came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to protect. For this treachery the inhabitants
were but ill prepared. The greater portion
of the English army had been disbanded, and
the rest were insignificant in comparison with
the new enemy against which they were called
to act. The consequence was, that for a considerable
time the foreign army passed from
one part of the island to the other, burning
and destroying whatever they met with, without
meeting any resistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A force was hastily organised for the
purpose of driving these treacherous friends
out of the country. The old and young of all
parties and opinions rushed to the national
standard with the hope of freeing their native
land from foreign rule. A battle ensued.
Nothing could exceed the desperate bravery of
my countrymen; but the discipline of their
enemy was not to be resisted. The people
were slaughtered in multitudes, and I, who
commanded one of the wings of the army on
that occasion, was the only general officer who
retreated from the field with anything like a
respectable body of men. We were attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
as we retreated by a force greatly our superior;
but I continued to show a resolute front, beat
off the assailants, and maintained a successful
fight. I succeeded in placing my men within
the shelter of impregnable walls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people had by this time become sick
of war. Thirty years of continued bloodshed
had done destructive work all over the country.
The population had been greatly reduced;
agriculture had been neglected; commerce
was rapidly decaying; manufactures had been
destroyed; all the resources of industry had
been annihilated; poverty, misery, and ruin
existed throughout the land. The people sued
for peace. The enemy sent back a message:&mdash;it
was, &lsquo;England must be destroyed;&rsquo; and
still they continued their relentless work of
pillage, burning, and slaughter. But the spirit
of the nation was not utterly broken. They
still waged a defensive and offensive war whenever
there was an opportunity of doing so with
advantage. Every small party of the enemy
were cut off, stragglers killed wherever met
with, and their army harassed in every way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
that hatred and ingenuity could devise. Bands
of well-armed Englishmen, from fifty to a thousand
in number, under separate and independent
leaders, surprised positions, destroyed convoys,
and cut off supplies. A new plan of warfare was
now attempted, which, although destructive to
the country, was found a most effective means
of expelling the invaders. This was, wherever
the enemy approached, to burn the dwellings,
and to move or destroy every kind of provision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About this period, there appeared amongst
the crowd of wretched beings who congregated
the cities, a new and malignant epidemic. How
it first originated was a mystery. It came, and
none knew from what cause. Its fatal character
was soon proved. At first, the people died in
tens and twenties, then they perished by
hundreds, and then thousands fell victims to its
malignity. The rich fled from their town
houses into the country, carrying with them
the very infection from which they were flying,
and in a short time it penetrated into the most
remote corner of the kingdom. Where the
population had not been extensive, there were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
left enough to bury the dead. In some rural
districts they died, and none knew of their
decease. It attacked all constitutions with the
same violence: the old, the young, the strong
and the weak, were its continual victims. The
rich were as much subject to its ravages as the
poor. There was no condition or class of society
in which the disease did not enter and
carry off the majority of its members.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The system which had been pursued,
chiefly under my direction, against the enemy,
gave them considerable annoyance; but still the
inhabitants generally would have done anything
to have purchased the blessings of peace.
Again was the boon sued for, and the reply
was, &lsquo;You haughty islanders have continued
too long to lord it over the world. We have
been your victims many a time; but now you
shall be ours&mdash;England must be destroyed.&rsquo;
They might have triumphed over our hostility;
they might, by keeping up a communication
with their ships, continue to have supplies of
provision and forage independent of the country;
but they saw that they could not escape the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
plague: and, after effecting all the mischief they
could produce, they hastened to their vessels,
and sailed from the pestilential shores they had
come to conquer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had not mingled in the sufferings of my
country without having to endure my own
share. I had found my home burnt to the
ground, and my wife sacrificed in the flames.
Three of my sons had died fighting by my side.
But worse suffering was now in store for me:
the plague was amongst us. I had used every
precaution to prevent the infection spreading
among my relatives. I had retired to a dwelling
up a steep mountain in the west, and there
I resided with my children and their families.
There were four of my sons, strong, robust men,
well inured to all the dangers of war; and there
were their wives, all of healthy constitutions,
and their children, of different ages, every one
full of health and spirits. With these were my
two daughters, with their husbands and families,
none of whom were touched by the slightest
illness. One morning I was congratulating
them upon the beneficial effect of my regulations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to prevent the spread of the infection, and the
mothers looked at their children and the husbands
on their wives, and I gazed on all, with
a delight we found to be unspeakable. In less
than a week I had buried them all but one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the old man&rsquo;s voice sunk, and he appeared
to be powerfully agitated. No one attempted
an observation; and after making a
strong effort to recover his self-possession, he
continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The survivor was a boy of ten years of age;
he was one of the few whom the plague had
touched and spared. Me it had passed by
harmless. But the destruction caused by the
pestilence exceeded all calculation. As in my
case, whole families were carried off, and districts
entirely depopulated. The pits that were
dug to throw in the dead were quickly filled,
and none were strong enough to dig others.
The dead cart stood in the street with its load
piled up; for both the driver and the horse had
been destroyed by the pestilence. Physicians
and surgeons appeared to have been the earliest
of its victims. They came to visit their patients,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and they died by the bedside. All remedies were
tried without avail; all precautions were used,
but they were equally useless. There were
different opinions existing as to its origin. The
royalists said that it was a punishment for the
sins of the republicans; and the republicans
retorted by proclaiming that it was a judgment
on the profligacy of the royalists. Religious
fanatics went running about the deserted streets,
with streaming hair and blood-shot eyes, shouting
out, in piercing tones, &lsquo;Wo! wo! the day of
judgment is at hand!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This lasted for the better portion of a year;
and, after putting the boy in a place of safety,
when the pestilence was over, as I journeyed
through the country to notice the effects it had
produced, where I had once known crowded
thoroughfares, I passed along without meeting
a single inhabitant. The country appeared to
have been completely unpeopled; and in the
city, the few persons I met with only made the
immense mortality which had existed appear
more great. I inquired for the government,
and found that not a trace of it was in existence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
I asked for the army, and I was
shown about a couple of hundred men. I
called a meeting of the citizens in the metropolis,
and they all came; and they filled a
moderate sized room. I explained to them the
deplorable state into which the plague had
reduced the country, and I asked their counsel
and assistance to form some sort of government
to manage its affairs. There was a
melancholy silence for some minutes. None
attempted to speak. Their hearts seemed too
full for utterance. At last one of the citizens
ventured to wish that I would do what I
thought best for the community; and I did do
what I thought best. I travelled through every
part of this once populous island to notice with
my own eyes the exact state of the remaining
population. Some cities I found deserted; in
others two-thirds of their buildings were untenanted;
the rank grass was growing in the
public streets, and the gardens of the rich were
filled with nettles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the measure of afflictions for this
unhappy country had not yet been filled up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
No sooner had the pestilence abated, than
another enemy, scarcely less dreadful, made its
appearance. The continued ravages of war
had prevented the tilling of the fields. No one
would attempt to sow, knowing how insecure
would be his ownership of the crop he might
produce. There had been no grain, and no
fruits, and no vegetables; and the cattle had
died of the plague, or had been destroyed by
the enemy. It was in vain attempting to get a
supply from foreign countries. Our commerce
had been destroyed, for no nation would hold
communication with a people among whom
raged so destructive a pestilence. They avoided
the shores of England as if death was on its
soil; and any vessel attempting to communicate
with them, or to enter one of their ports, was
fired at and sunk. The consequence was, our
ships lay rotting in the docks, and their crews
were either dead, or had dispersed over the
island, and were not to be found. The terrific
visitation of famine was now upon us. Every
thing was eaten that the human stomach could
be brought to swallow. Things the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
loathsome to the taste, and offensive to the eyes,
were readily and ravenously devoured. Then
the cheek sunk; the eye-ball fell; the flesh
dwindled away; and all crawled with half lifeless
limbs in search of any substance that might
lessen the cravings of their appetites. But at
last every thing that was digestible disappeared,
and the skeleton forms of the sufferers were
stretched stiffly on the place where they fell&mdash;some
in madness, some in despair, and all in
agony and dread.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no opportunity allowed me for
legislating with any advantage. I thought of
every plan that afforded the slightest assistance
towards lessening the dreadful effects
of the calamity which the whole country
was enduring; but I met with no one to second
my exertions. The few who retained the use
of their faculties were feeble and emaciated.
Famine was in their gaunt limbs, and despair
upon their aching hearts. No one appeared
inclined to pay the slightest attention to
any thing but his own sufferings. There was
no authority but that of the strong, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
who retained their physical power the longest,
robbed the dying of such slight nourishment as
they had acquired. The rich would bring out
their treasures and offer them for a meal, and
when some avaricious wretch was found to
make the exchange, one more strong than
either would come by, and wrest the food from
the impoverished, and the wealth from the
miser; and both died within the hour. The
breast of the mother became dry, and the
infant was abandoned to starve when it became
an incumbrance to the famished parent. Cats,
dogs, rats, mice, and every kind of animal, no
matter how disgusting in its habits, had been
greedily devoured; birds, fish, and insects, that
had previously been considered loathsome, were
sought after as delicacies; and weeds, roots,
the leaves of trees, offal, and even many things
still more objectionable, became the daily food
of many who had been accustomed to the most
luxurious fare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finding that I could do no good among
the scanty band of skeletons that clung to a
lingering existence, I determined on endeavouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to make my way to the northern part
of the island, where an industrious and hardy
race had managed to retain their independence
and prosperity during the wars, the pestilence,
and the famine, that ravaged its southern
portion. My grandson was too young to walk
great distances; so, when he was tired, I placed
him upon my shoulder, and thus we journeyed
on our way. Our food was acorns, berries,
roots, and leaves. Sometimes I was enabled to
catch a fish, or a bird, or a small animal; but
these were luxuries seldom to be enjoyed. We
passed several parties apparently intent upon
the same object as ourselves; but many were
there of the groups who laid themselves down
on the road-side weary and famishing, and
there perished. Continually I came upon
some individual made desperate by his hunger,
scratching up the earth with his hands in
search of the worms it contained, which, if
found, were eaten with as much enjoyment as
the most delicious meats, and if the search was
fruitless, the dry soil was crammed into the
mouth as a substitute. Very few of the travellers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
could have reached the end of their
journey, for we continued to pass the dying
and the dead as far as we proceeded. Sometimes
a solitary wretch would be found prostrate
at the foot of a tree, the bark of which he
had evidently been gnawing; further on a
family of children were discovered, with their
little bodies shrunk to the bone, and the parents
at a short distance, with their faces turned
from them, as if they could not look upon
their sufferings; and in another place, a lover
and his mistress lay clasped in each other&rsquo;s
fleshless arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were crossing an extensive and barren
moor, when we came before a group of dead
bodies, among which, to my exceeding astonishment,
I beheld a child&mdash;a delicate girl of five or
six years of age&mdash;busily occupied in chasing a
butterfly. The scene was so extraordinary that
I stood gazing on it for a considerable period
before I could determine what to do. The
insect&rsquo;s gaudy wings kept fluttering over the
lifeless forms that were cold and stiff on the
ground, sometimes alighting on a hand, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
on a face; and the child, in an ecstasy of
delight, screaming, and laughing, and stretching
out its little arms, pursued it from place to
place. What a time was this for reflection!
Here was life in the midst of death&mdash;the pursuit
of pleasure among the most fatal and least
endurable examples of pain. It was a wonderful
sight! The girl seemed to know neither
want nor sorrow; and continued her sport, indifferent
to the spectral shapes that lay extended
at her feet. Their ghastly stare, and
gaunt visages, had no terrors for her. The
hunt of the butterfly occupied all her thoughts,
and the hope of attaining possession of its
beautiful colours seemed the only desire entertained.
After watching her movements with
indescribable interest for several minutes, I advanced
towards the child, and invited her to
go with me. I had considerable difficulty to
get her to leave the butterfly; and when I led
her away from the spot, she chatted with infantile
volubility, as if there was nothing else
but the butterfly in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found the people of the northern provinces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
hospitable, and with them I lived for
nearly half a century. They escaped the ravages
of the pestilence by not allowing any infected
persons from the neighbouring counties,
who crowded towards the borders, to enter into
their territory. None had presented themselves
during the prevalence of the famine but myself;
and their own frugality saved them from the
horrors which had desolated England. They
looked upon the southern portion of the island
as a doomed country, for although several
parties from the north had gone there for the
purpose of forming settlements, they either
returned after a short stay, stating that neither
cattle nor crops would nourish on the land, or
were never more heard of, and were supposed
to have fallen victims to the pirates who occasionally
visited the coast. I passed my time in
educating the two children of whom I had taken
charge, and both made great progress under
my instructions. The boy became a fine, active,
intelligent man, the girl an admirable example
of womankind; and as I found that their hearts
were for each other, in due time I had them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
made man and wife. I have outlived them and
all their progeny, with the exception of Lilya,
whom, after the decease of her family, I took
with me to England, having at the time an
ardent desire to revisit its desolated shores.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I found England I need scarcely describe;
you see it before you. It was a complete
ruin. A sad and miserable remnant of her
people did strive to till the land; but the soil
refused to give sustenance to the seed, and the
cultivator could gather nothing but a harvest of
weeds. The earth was abandoned for the
waters, and the farmers became fishermen; but
the sea and the river gave an inadequate supply.
One by one the inhabitants dropped off, till at
last the only human creatures within the
country were myself and Lilya. We managed
to subsist by hunting and fishing. Our fare was
not at all times very delicate, and was seldom
very plentiful; but we provided for ourselves
tolerably well. We were obliged to rely upon
our own resources; for the savage appearance of
the island, and the belief that it was doomed to
destruction, prevented our being visited by any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
vessels from the continent; and even the pirates
from the neighbouring islands, having found that
the country contained nothing to tempt them
to a visit, turned their attention to more opulent
regions. Lilya and I, therefore, had the
whole land to ourselves, and over it we held
absolute sovereignty. Even the savage monsters
of the forest appeared to acknowledge our supremacy,
for none offered to molest us. We
took our way through deserted piles and fallen
monuments; and if we disturbed the lion in his
lair, or the eagle in his eyrie, they made way for
our approach, and returned to their haunts when
we were gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus passed the time. Lilya grew up as
you see&mdash;a child of the forest, skilful in snaring
game, and in preserving skins; affectionate
in her manner, gentle in her temper, and shy
as a dove in her nest. As for me, I was a wanderer
over the lands of my forefathers. The
stream, the vale, the mountain, and the plain,
were accustomed to my visits. I became a
denizen of the forest and the plain&mdash;a resident
in the deserted cities. I found a dwelling in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the palace and the hut; and all places were my
home. I experienced a melancholy pleasure in
beholding the scenes in which the greatness of
my country had once been exhibited. I walked
among the crumbling ruins of her once gorgeous
halls. The sunken roofs of her stately cathedrals
for me were full of religious awe and
veneration; the dilapidated battlements of her
ancient castles seemed still to show the dauntless
valour of the spirits by whom they had
been defended; and the moss and lichens that
disfigured her public monuments gave only a
fresher interest to the worth they represented.
From these I gathered the memories of a better
time, and the glories of the past warmed my
old heart with the vigour of a second youth.
I lived over again the departed age&mdash;I recalled
to life the buried generations&mdash;I contemplated
the happiness which the grave had long since
hid in her bosom&mdash;and the discoloured stones
around me seemed to echo the busy goings on
of an industrious population. Free hearts were
throbbing proudly around me, and the stillness of
the desert along which I stalked was made alive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
with the pleasures of the young, the noble, and
the brave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone is your glory, oh my country!&rdquo; exclaimed
the old man, in a more feeble voice;
&ldquo;your greatness among the nations is put down;
your magnificence has dwindled to a heap of
stones; your power has nothing by which it
may be known. If the stranger come in a few
years, and inquire for the city which was the
wonder of the world, none shall tell him, for
both city and citizens will have crumbled into
dust. If he ask for the people whose name was
a glory in every clime that exists, he shall find
no better reply than the echo of his own voice.
He may wander over the brave old island in
search of places that history has made immortal,
without being able to discover a trace of
their existence. The thistle and the nettle will
hide the graves of its illustrious; ravenous
beasts will prowl in its cities; and all that is
noble and grand in its localities will be crushed,
swallowed, and lost in one devouring ruin;
and I, that am here as an ancient tree with
gnarled trunk and brittle boughs, that stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
up as if unnoticed by the destroyer, when the
rest of the forest have mouldered into the soil,
will then have perished and passed away, and
not even a remembrance of my name will be
left upon the land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noble old man!&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel Porphyry
with fervour, &ldquo;there is no one here who does
not sympathise with your situation. I would
endeavour to console you, but I am afraid that
your case is one beyond all consolation. What
can I do to render you assistance? Let me
prevail on you to leave this land, which has been
so completely devoted to destruction, and I will
find you a more attractive home, and friends as
kind as those you have lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave this land!&rdquo; loudly cried the Englishman,
apparently astonished at the suggestion.
&ldquo;For a hundred and twenty years this island has
been the attraction of all my thoughts; my love
for it arose from admiration of its magnificence,
and my heart still clings to it in its utter annihilation.
Do you think it would be possible for
me, after having made myself so familiar with
its ruins, to find pleasure in the prosperity of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
far off country? No! to me the world hath
nothing like it. What are smiling landscapes?
What are stately edifices? What are fields
busy with life, and cities astir with industry, if
on a foreign shore? Its homes are not my
home&mdash;its graves are not the graves of my
people. But these tottering walls and depopulated
lands are mine; I hold them in undisputed
possession; I have a claim on them which has
been long acknowledged; and they have a claim
on me which I feel I must speedily prepare to
liquidate. No: leave me to the desolation in
which I dwell. It has become habitual&mdash;it has
become necessary. I have long, perhaps too
long, been its inhabitant; but the hour comes
when another ruin must be added to those
which now encumber the soil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then what is to become of the gentle
Lilya?&rdquo; inquired the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! &rsquo;tis of that I am ever anxious,&rdquo; replied
the old man, with a look of affectionate
solicitude towards his youthful relative. &ldquo;The
child is full of amiable ways&mdash;she is artless and
untutored: I cannot part with her; and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to leave her unprotected in this wilderness is a
source of constant disquietude to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you entrust her to me,&rdquo; added Oriel,
&ldquo;by the honour of manhood I promise to behave
to her as a brother; and I will place her
under the protection of a lady from whom she
will receive every attention her youth and unfriended
situation requires.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In her name I can promise all that she
stands most in need of,&rdquo; said Zabra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What say you, my Lilya?&rdquo; inquired the
Englishman. &ldquo;Will you go with the strangers?
Will you leave this wretched country, and seek
one where happiness awaits you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have no other country but yours, oh
my protector!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, as she flung
herself into the old man&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;These
strangers are good; but they can never be so
good as you have been: and these old walls too&mdash;where
shall I meet with such verdant moss,
or such beautiful ivy, as they possess? While
you live, with you must my existence be passed:
and when you have ceased to lead me in my
wanderings through the silent forest or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
deserted city, I care not where I go; for I shall
never again find the parent, the friend and
guardian I shall have lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Englishman pressed her more closely to
his breast.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_VI" id="CHAP_VI">CHAP. VI.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE DEATH OF THE LAST OF THE ENGLISHMEN.</span></h2>


<p class="noi">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My</span> life is drawing rapidly to its close,&rdquo; faltered
the old man; &ldquo;my weary pilgrimage is
nearly over. Farewell, ye solitary halls and
voiceless palaces! Farewell, ye grassy streets
and ivied porticoes! The eyes that have gazed
upon ye in your splendour, and watched ye
gradually passing into ruin, will soon be
darkened and closed. The heart that hath
drawn so many pleasures from your unfading
braveries is fast sinking into that state of
nothingness to which you all hasten. City of
the silent! he who worshipped your prosperity,
and loved your decay, must now pass from
amidst your ruined dwellings. Like your time-honoured
walls, I totter and tremble, and am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
ready to fall upon the earth that supports me&mdash;the
ivy seems twining up my unsteady limbs,
and the moss is spreading over my ancient
heart. Farewell, ye untasted pastures, ye
uncultivated fields, ye gardens of weeds and
orchards of brambles&mdash;the wildness of your
looks shall welcome me no more. Farewell, ye
hoary mountains and savage rocks, ye untrodden
forests and unhonored streams&mdash;the same iron
hand that hath visited ye so heavily, as heavily
must fall on me. I pass from among ye, oh
land of my fathers! Your earth shall receive
me to her breast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man lay on a green bank overgrown
with wild flowers, while Oriel and Zabra supported
his head. Lilya was reclining at his
side, with one of his hands at her lips, and her
face hid on his breast, and she spoke only in
convulsive sobs. Tourniquet stood near him
feeling his pulse, and the professor was close
beside endeavouring to administer consolation.
At a short distance stood the captain
and midshipman, with part of the crew of the
Albatross, apparently taking a deep interest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the scene. They were congregated together
near a shelving hillock in the neighbourhood of
an extensive marsh. Before them was an
ancient arch of marble, and beyond that, the
ruins of a structure evidently once of very
great extent and magnificence, with many
statues, some standing where they had been
placed, and others lying mutilated among the
heaps of stones that were piled up around the
place for a considerable distance. The sun
was declining in the heavens, and the day was
bright and warm. Ruins, in different stages of
decay, were observed as far as the eye could
reach in every direction, except towards the
west, where an open space showed the distant
hills, over which the sun was hastening his
descent.</p>

<p>It was evident that the Englishman was
dying. His venerable brow was covered with
a thick perspiration, and his fine countenance
had become more pallid and anxious than it
had previously been. Yet his eyes beamed
as if they had lost none of their accustomed
brilliancy, and his noble form possessed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
same dignity which had first attracted the
attention of the voyagers. He was still in
possession of all his faculties, and there was
an energy in his manner, and an impressiveness
in his language, which proved that the spirit
that had outlived so many generations had
lost none of its youthful vigour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your pulse is getting more feeble, don&rsquo;t
you see?&rdquo; said the doctor, with much sympathy
for his patient; &ldquo;and I regret to be obliged
to agree with you in stating that your hours
are numbered. You have lived far beyond the
usual term of life, and it must be a great consolation
to you, in your present state, to know
that you have lived all that time in honour, and
worth, and virtue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be grateful to Providence that you have
been so long spared,&rdquo; observed Fortyfolios.
&ldquo;The age of man is threescore and ten, and
this is but rarely attained; and yet your existence
has been prolonged to nearly double
that length of time. How much have you to
be thankful for! Consider the myriads of
human beings who are cut off unprepared;&mdash;who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
die in infancy, in early youth, or perfect
manhood&mdash;who just begin to taste the sweets
of life, and then are hurried from its enjoyment.
Consider the advantages you have enjoyed
over your fellow-countrymen, who were destroyed
by war, by pestilence, and famine.
You have much reason to congratulate yourself.
You have been spared, doubtless, for some
admirable purpose which our finite reason
cannot comprehend. Reflect upon these things,
and you will be enabled to meet the approach
of death without apprehension.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are your wishes concerning the
disposal of Lilya?&rdquo; inquired Oriel Porphyry.
&ldquo;Remember that it is impossible that she can
be left alone upon this island with the slightest
comfort to herself or pleasure to others. The
offer I made to you the other day I repeat. It
is not probable that her welfare can be secured
more effectively in any other way. Let me
implore you then, as you value her future happiness,
to take advantage of my accidental
arrival, and give me authority to bear her to a
secure and honourable asylum.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be so, oh my Lilya,&rdquo; exclaimed
the old man affectionately. &ldquo;When I have
left you, this desolate place can be no proper
home for you. You must accompany these
kind strangers to their own country. There
you will find that protection and care which is
necessary to make you pass through life with
the esteem of your associates. Remember, oh
my Lilya, that if you wish the spirit of the
old man who has been your constant companion
in all your journeyings to rest satisfied with
his afterlife, your conduct must be irreproachable,
and you must endeavour to keep your
mind free from the approach of all degrading
errors. The world is open before you; but
although you will find it fruitful in every delicious
produce&mdash;though it possess the most
lovely landscapes, and is peopled by multitudes
of the good and generous, there is less ruin in
the desolation you see around you than exists
in those fair and fertile shores. I part with
you with much regret&mdash;deeply does my heart
feel the separation&mdash;but it must be. The evil
has no remedy. It ought to be endured without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
a murmur. Go then, my Lilya, to the land of
the stranger, and my blessing shall be upon your
footsteps, like an eternal sunshine, wherever
they may wander. But in whatever part of the
world you may make your sojourn, forget not
that the land from whence you came exceeded
in glory and in excellence all other lands that
have existed since the creation of the world.
Do it no dishonour. Show that you are worthy
to acknowledge the place of your nativity;
and if you should hear the idle, the ungenerous,
and the thoughtless attempt to lower her fame,
or seek to question her superiority, stand up
in her defence with all the eloquence that truth
inspires and patriotism makes perfect; and
speak of the good she has done, and the
wonders she has achieved, and then the most
illiberal and unjust of your audience shall find
their erroneous impressions fade before your
convincing eulogy, and with a new and better
spirit they shall say, &lsquo;Would that I had been
an Englishman!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lilya answered only with her sobs, which
now became quicker and more vehement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be gratifying to you to know that
your country has never been enslaved,&rdquo; remarked
the young merchant, earnestly. &ldquo;While
other lands have been degraded by the vilest
spirit of despotism, the energies of the public
men of England kept her unshackled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stand on the grave of a mighty empire,&rdquo;
replied the Englishman, &ldquo;who has erected
monuments of her greatness in every quarter
of the globe. I am hurrying to the same
sepulchre. In such a situation, more than in
any other, it is natural that I should speak the
words of truth and honesty. It is my conviction,
then, that this country could never have
fallen from its greatness, except through its
own internal dissensions. When it enjoyed an
unexampled state of prosperity, there existed
men calling themselves patriots, yet possessing
no claim to such a title, who kept the multitude
in a restless and unsatisfied state, by their continual
abuse of its institutions, and frequent
demands for change. If these individuals could
have been believed on their own testimony,
they were the most disinterested set of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
that ever existed. They had no motive except
for the common good. They had no feeling
separate from the interests of the community.
In my time there flourished few more ardent
lovers of liberty than myself; my inclination
for freedom was a passion, an enthusiasm, a
dream. I seemed to see nothing but chains
where a fetter never existed, and found nothing
but slavery in a state of society that enjoyed a
higher degree of independence than any in the
world. My connection with the popular party
brought me much into contact with the influencial
patriots; and I found them the most selfish,
narrow-minded, bigotted men that ever disgraced
a country: they had no other desire but
for their own aggrandisement. They fawned
upon the people till they became possessed of
the power they coveted, and then endeavoured
to exert a more absolute authority than had
ever been exhibited by the government they
superseded. Self was the great object of all their
exertions, and to selfish ends their fine speeches
and liberal promises always tended. They had
no care for the multitude except as steps for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
their own advancement. Freedom still appears
to me in the same alluring guise in which she
first won me to follow in her footsteps, and amid
the solitude of this uncultivated wild I have enjoyed
more of her smiles than the most perfect
form of government could create; but my experience
has convinced me that a vast population
must be well prepared for a change in their
constitution, that promises a considerable accession
of liberty, as it is called, before it can
be enjoyed with safety to the commonwealth.
Sudden changes never come to any good. The
whole frame-work of society is unhinged by
them; opinions are unsettled, the public confidence
is withdrawn, the reverence for the old
is broken, and the new being untried, cannot be
regarded with the same respect as a state of
things which has existed for centuries. I have
noticed this; and it proves that revolutions in
systems of government that have any lasting
value should be introduced by the gradual
growth of public opinion, and that any system
of government that produces a certain quantity
of benefit to the people, however faulty it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
be in other respects, is preferable to any other
system of government which has been untried,
and the utility of which, therefore, has not been
ascertained. I am convinced that the dissolution
of this great empire originated in the
dissatisfaction in the public mind for the existing
laws, which had been artfully created by
numbers of mock patriots, such as may be
found in all states enjoying liberty of opinion,
for the purpose of realising schemes they had
entertained for their own advantage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But true patriotism may exist in a state,
though the false may be predominant, don&rsquo;t
you see,&rdquo; remarked Tourniquet; &ldquo;and it is too
sterling a thing to be set aside, because any
constitution which governs the many possesses
some acknowledged merit. The real patriotism
may always be known from the false by its self-abandonment,
and the true patriot seeks no
other advantage than the public good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the history of nations of any celebrity,&rdquo;
said Fortyfolios, &ldquo;there can be nothing more
interesting to the student than to observe their
gradual rise, decline, and fall. They first arise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
out of an obscurity so profound, that among
earlier empires they were known, if known at
all, only as a few straggling savages. These
multiply and become enlightened, build cities
and ships, cultivate the land and invent manufactures,
make war and obtain great triumphs;
and as they advance in civilisation their resources
increase, their intelligence becomes more general,
and at last they acquire a superiority over
the most important nations at such a time
existing in the world. This power they retain
as long as they are united, wise, and brave;
but immediately a disunion appears, a complete
disorganisation takes place, every thing goes
wrong, and the whole fabric, so elaborately
built up, tumbles to pieces. They once more
become reduced to wandering savages, and their
country is again a wilderness. All the earliest
nations of antiquity have been thus created, and
thus have perished: and as Carthage, Egypt,
Troy, and numberless other states of equal
importance in the youth of the world, were
dissolved till nothing remained of them but
the name, so has England, infinitely their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
superior, both in public intelligence and in
public glory, arrived at a dissolution as desolating
and complete. The subject of inquiry
for the philosopher now is, whether kingdoms
or commonwealths, having returned to the
state of barbarism from which they advanced,
will not at a proper period again progress in
civilisation till they once more arrive at the
pre-eminence from which they had fallen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The spirit of the future is upon me!&rdquo;
exclaimed the last of the Englishmen, in an
elevated tone of voice, and with his countenance
lit up with deep and powerful excitement.
&ldquo;The glory of the past rises from its sepulchre
with renewed life, and a power exceeding all
experience. Again the ruin rings with life,
and the wilderness is a smiling garden, fruitful
in human happiness. The voices of industry
now cheer every corner of the solitary city, and
the laugh of pleasure awakens the gloomy
recesses of the forest with an inspiring feeling
of gladness. Now are the broad waters of the
abandoned river covered with shipping of every
maritime nation under the sun; and in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
sea that flows beneath the arching vault of
the everlasting heavens, the dauntless mariners
of England dash along, triumphing over the
tempest and the foe. The magnificence, the
bravery, the intelligence, the virtue, and the
might of former times now rise before my gaze,
multiplied tenfold in degree. I see the banners
of a thousand victories; the shouts of freedom
and the glad pæans of triumph swell upon my
ear; the pomp of stirring music&mdash;the beauty
of art in its noblest creations&mdash;the perfection
of unrivalled manufactures&mdash;the imposing array
of palaces of streets and streets of palaces,
stupendous bridges, noble monuments, and
stately halls;&mdash;the throngs of the noble, the
great, the good, the wise and the industrious,
with sumptuous equipages, numerous retinues,
gay liveries, or joyous faces, and happy hearts,
become evident to my senses. I see the felicitous
influence of a wise government exercised
upon a flourishing and contented population
countless as the stars. I see societies, and
families, and individuals, all sharing in the
general joy. I see wealth, abundance, skill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and industry, flowing in a refreshing channel
that fertilises the whole island. I behold thee,
oh, my country! the proudest of the nations,
whose laws govern the seas, and whose name
is absolute on the dry land, rising from the
darkness and the desolation which now shrouds
thy greatness, and with a prouder dignity,
and a fresher splendour, and a power more
universal than to one nation ever belonged
resume thy ancient throne upon the waters,
and commence a reign which shall far exceed
in glory all the glories by which it has ever
been preceded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man fell back exhausted into the
arms of Oriel and Zabra, and it was at first
feared that his spirit had departed; but in a
few moments respiration gently recommenced,
the look of life beamed in his gaze, and he
returned to a state of consciousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will not last long, don&rsquo;t you see;&rdquo; said
the doctor to his companions. &ldquo;Though the
intellectual powers have suffered but little, the
physical are nearly destroyed. He is but lingering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
on his journey. His resting-place is
close at hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see the sun;&rdquo; exclaimed the Englishman,
with the same enthusiastic fervour
he had previously exhibited, as he endeavoured
to turn himself in the required direction. His
hearers lifted him up gently, so that he could
have a full view of that majestic luminary as it
was setting behind the western hills. &ldquo;Let
me again behold that glorious orb whose uprisings
and whose goings down I have witnessed
so long and proudly. Ha! There still spread
the ruddy tints&mdash;the glow of fire and gold is
upon the skies once more;&mdash;there are the gorgeous
colours and radiant splendours that have
so often shed their magnificence upon our ancient
island. Once again, O wondrous Oread,
I drink in delighted the sweet effulgence of
your rays. They warm me, they cheer me,
they invigorate the flagging current still flowing
through my veins. How many times have I
looked upon your rising and your setting!&mdash;and
on every fresh occasion have exclaimed
how lovely! how new! how wonderful! And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
now for the last time, I watch ye taking the
accustomed path, clothed in that panoply of
state that knows of no decay. Stay, stay a
little in your course: your rising on the
morrow will not be for my enjoyment; for, with
your setting, on me sets the world. Stay,
bright harbinger of gladness, your task is not
yet done;&mdash;there is a soul fondly hovering on
your beams, that, as you fade, must pass away.
Slowly your glories dissolve into the cloud, and
with them the impulses of my existence disappear.
The fires around you, are becoming
faint, and the flame that burns in this receptacle
is trembling, and flickering, and dying
into darkness. Still I follow you over the
distant hills, now purpled with your beauty.
Heaven and earth are fading from my sight,
and England, the land of my birth and grave,
of my long pilgrimage and devoted love,
passeth from my view like a cloud in the nighttime.
Lilya! my blessing be upon you from
now to eternity. Friends, I submit her to
your care with a thankfulness that language
cannot speak. I die with many consolations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
I have no enemies to forgive;&mdash;I have had
none to sin against. I die in the religion of
my fathers, with glory to God and good will
towards men. See, the last streak of crimson
over the hill, just above the fading disc of the
setting sun. Watch it&mdash;my spirit is hastening
to share in its splendours. See,&mdash;it
lessens&mdash;it fades&mdash;&rsquo;t is gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man had extended his arm towards
that part of the horizon to which he wished to
attract attention; and as the last words of the
preceding sentence were uttered, the disc of the
sun disappeared over the hills, the arm fell, the
head dropped, and without a sigh, the spirit of
the last of the Englishmen had departed to its
eternal rest. Lilya, in an uncontrollable agony
of grief, flung herself upon the corpse; and
there was scarcely a person present who was
not deeply affected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he quite dead?&rdquo; whispered the young
merchant, observing that Tourniquet had his
fingers upon his wrist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to be more so, don&rsquo;t you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
see;&rdquo; replied the surgeon, as he dropped the
lifeless arm by the side of the body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had better give him christian burial
before we leave the island;&rdquo; remarked Fortyfolios.
&ldquo;The wild beasts, it seems, are numerous
about here, and it would not be a
friendly act to leave his body to be devoured
by them. I do not know whether there is any
consecrated ground near, but I should think
in a city so celebrated for the number of its
churches, a burial-place cannot be far off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not have his remains mingle with
the herd that choke up a church-yard;&rdquo; exclaimed
Oriel Porphyry. &ldquo;He shall have a
more honourable sepulchre. About a mile
hence I noticed the colossal statue of some
distinguished hero. It is in a large park-like
place, slightly elevated, and at a considerable
distance from any ruins. We will bury him
at its base: it is a grave such as his free spirit
would have loved to contemplate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young merchant instantly gave orders
about the funeral, and while the preparations
were being made, he, assisted by Zabra, drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Lilya from the body, which she could not be
induced to leave without force. The seamen
had brought with them some pickaxes and
shovels for the purpose of digging for antiquities,
and these were now to be called into
use for a more melancholy occasion. Every
one being in readiness, twelve sailors with
muskets reversed, walked slowly two abreast:
then came the body, still in its dress of wild
skins, wrapped up in the Columbian flag, and
carried by eight men upon four muskets crossed.
After them walked Lilya, supported by Oriel
Porphyry and Zabra. They were followed by
Fortyfolios and Tourniquet, and the captain
and the midshipman, and the procession was
closed by twelve seamen marching slowly, two
abreast, with arms reversed.</p>

<p>They passed along what appeared to be the
remains of a road, for about half a mile, when
they came to a magnificent ancient triumphal
arch, a splendid example of architectural beauty,
standing in excellent preservation, with a colossal
equestrian statue of a warrior trampling
under his horse&rsquo;s feet a group of warlike figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in different costumes. An illegible inscription,
supposed to be a list of victories gained over
the enemies of his country by the original of
the statue, was placed under the prostrate
group, and beneath them in large capitals that
might be read at a great distance, was observed
the word &ldquo;WELLINGTON.&rdquo; This admirable
work of antiquity was divided into a large
central arch and two smaller ones, one on each
side. They were richly sculptured in bas relief,
and adorned with every appropriate architectural
ornament.</p>

<p>Passing beneath this grand triumphal monument,
the funeral train observed another of
a less imposing character just before them,
which was much dilapidated. To reach it,
they had to walk through a field of weeds and
high grass, which at different places, showed
signs of having once been a fine broad public
thoroughfare; and venturing under the tottering
walls of this arch, they entered an
expansive field of docks and nettles, wild
flowers, and gigantic thistles. Ruins of considerable
buildings were observed on the right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Clumps of trees were scattered in every direction,
and about the centre, on a high mound,
stood a colossal bronze statue of an ancient
warrior, supposed to be some illustrious English
general. It was a splendid specimen
of sculpture, and appeared to be of great
antiquity.</p>

<p>Here it was intended should be consigned
the remains of the heroic old man, and the
seamen having dug a deep grave at the foot
of the statue, he was deposited on the bank,
where he lay wrapped up in the flag for a few
minutes to give to every one an opportunity
of seeing him for the last time. Lilya knelt
down by the side of the dead body, kissed the
cold hand, and covered it with her tears. Many
attempts were made to tranquillise her grief,
but without success. Every head was uncovered
as the professor read the funeral service,
and even the hardy seaman seemed much
affected by the impressive character of the
scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The brevity of existence has been much
insisted on,&rdquo; observed Fortyfolios at the conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of the service; &ldquo;and here is an example
of the prolongation of life far beyond
the usual term, and prolonged under circumstances
remarkably rare and interesting.
This human antiquity bore all the marks of
greatness which were first impressed upon its
nature, through the violent changes that shook
to ruin the society to which it belonged. He
was brave, patriotic, noble, and patient. He
could draw hope from the materials of despair,
and find comfort in the midst of desolation. Let
us not murmur, then, at the small evils among
which we exist, when we find such admirable
endurance of evils of the greatest magnitude.
The love of country is a natural and amiable
virtue, but never has it sat so gracefully, and
existed with such disinterestedness, as in the
character of this ancient Englishman. He loved,
not because such love was a common feeling
which every object around him might excite;
but he loved as if he had calculated what
would be the amount of patriotism possessed
by his countrymen had they existed; and considering
himself as the representative of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
dead, endeavoured to exhibit the total of their
contributions; and this exhibition seemed the
more abundant, as the objects which should
have the most readily created it became the
least capable of exciting it into action. He
was a great man, and may be looked upon as
the last production of a great country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for the men who are vulgarly called
great, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; observed the doctor,
&ldquo;your kings, your conquerors, and such poor
cattle, they shrink into their proper insignificance
when compared to the last of the Englishmen.
How could they have endured the
barren waste and wilderness of ruins for any
length of time! They could have found nothing
to appreciate in its solitude, they would have
left its desolation in disgust. Patriotism here
was the most amiable of virtues. It was pure
and honest and excellent. It was full of truth
and courage, and a power that was invincible.
Let us honour this old man: the grave will
hold him fast. We shall see nothing of the
kind again. Let us then make the most of
his memory, for the estimation of such excellence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
will be always a proof of the existence of
a love of that which is best. The self-denials of
ascetics, and the mortifications of religious misanthropists,
who, shutting themselves up from
the sweet influence of social intercourse, hate
their fellows and torture themselves; what are
these compared with that nobler, purer, better
feeling which bound this old man to the grave
of his country, and made him find enjoyment
and consolation in the recollection of her immortal
excellences? Let us honour him, for he
is an example of how much honour humanity
may attain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot unwillingly join in praise so well
deserved,&rdquo; said Oriel Porphyry; &ldquo;the extraordinary
energy of his heroic nature that made
him endure with so cheerful a spirit the evils
under which generation after generation sunk
into utter hopelessness, is worthy of all the admiration
we can confer upon it. We will bury
him in the earth he loved so well; and although
we raise no monument to glorify his actions,
and although to strangers he be indebted for
the rites of sepulture, his sleep will not be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
less profound, nor his obsequies the less honourable.
Perhaps in some future age, when,
as he hath prophesied, this ancient nation shall
arrive at a degree of prosperity and greatness
far beyond any thing it has hitherto attained,
the people of the future imagining that this
monument has been erected over the mortal
remains of some heroic spirit of the early ages,
shall throng in crowds to confer on it the
homage of their reverence; and the fame,
though in error, will do him justice, and posterity,
though ignorant, will rightly apply their
admiration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grieve not, sweet Lilya!&rdquo; exclaimed
Zabra, as he was endeavouring to console the
afflicted mourner; &ldquo;he for whom you mourn
mourns not; why, therefore, should you be afflicted?
His spirit is at peace with the world; he
treads no more among the ruins and weeds of
this deserted land; his home is where nature
enjoys an unfading youth; where beauty
breathes from an unclouded atmosphere, and
love dwells around him like a perpetual blessing.
Grieve not for the loss of the goodness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
which was enshrined in his nature, it has gone
to join the First Great Cause of all good from
which its goodness was derived. You see the
wild flowers that are scattered at our feet; they
gather from the air and the soil their fragrance
and their loveliness, and these qualities they
give back to the air and the soil, when the
freshness of their leaves is dried up, and the
soft hues in which we so much delight fade
from their blossoms. Whatever exists, exists
in a state of continual giving and receiving. It
gains only to lose when what it has acquired
can no longer be rendered profitable to its
owner. As the rivers run into the sea, glides
all humanity into the boundless ocean of the
eternal; yet, fast as they empty themselves as
rapidly they flow from their sources, just as the
waters of life rush into the gulf of death, and
though swallowed up with inconceivable velocity,
rise from their innumerable springs in
greater abundance. Grieve not, then, for grief
is of no utility to either the living or the dead.
Consider yourself: in you are deposited the
materials of much happiness for yourself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
others; endeavour to apply them to the most
advantage. Some fond youth may soon be
looking on your eyes, as gazes the devotee on
the innermost sanctuary of his temple. In you
he will concentrate all his ideas of what is most
admirable; to you he will turn his thoughts;
for you he will breathe his aspirations; his
dreams he will gladden with your smiles; his
hopes he will make brilliant in the lustre of
your gaze. Are such things unworthy of your
contemplation? Leave off these regrets; quit
this senseless clay which answers not to your
sympathy. Strive to become all, when living,
he would have wished you to be. Virtue and
truth and wisdom invite you to partake of their
enjoyments, and if you attend to the better
business of life, under their instructive auspices,
you may be assured of becoming possessed of
such happiness as it is felicitous even to
imagine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lilya raised her eyes streaming with tears to
the handsome countenance of the speaker, and
her face was lit up with an expression that for
the time obliterated all traces of sorrow. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
this moment the body was carefully deposited
in the grave, over which the seamen fired a
volley of musketry, after which he was covered
with the soil, and the party returned to their
tents. Here, immediately on Zabra&rsquo;s arrival,
he proceeded to his harp, and after a few chords
full of melancholy and tender feeling, sang the
following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;The last of his race now lies low,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For him no dull trappings of woe,<br /></span>

<p>At the close of the song, Zabra felt a hand
placed lightly on his shoulder, and, turning
round, beheld Lilya gazing on him with a look
so full of pleasure, that he felt almost inclined
to doubt it was the same creature who a short
time since was so overpowered with affliction.
&ldquo;I will go with you,&rdquo; said the timid girl, as a
slight blush appeared on either cheek; &ldquo;I will
go with you to your own country&mdash;if&mdash;that is&mdash;I
should like to go with you if you will take
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same evening they were all on board the
Albatross, which immediately set sail, and retraced
her way through the river into the wide
ocean.</p>

<p class="noi">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">I am</span> getting very anxious about my father!&rdquo;
said Oriel Porphyry to his young friend; &ldquo;I am
sure something must have happened, or I should
have found a communication from him at one
or other of the different ports I have touched at.
Not a syllable of information have I been able
to gain from any of my father&rsquo;s ships I have
spoken with, for most of them had left Columbia
about the same time as my last advices, and the
others were not aware of any thing important
having transpired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going homewards now, Oriel, and
if any thing has happened shall soon be made
aware of it;&rdquo; observed Zabra. &ldquo;Let us hope
for the best. I should not imagine, from the
immense influence that he possesses, that the
government would attempt to injure him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They only want the power, I believe;&rdquo; replied
the young merchant. &ldquo;I know these
sort of people too well to put much confidence
in an appearance of tranquillity that has been
forced upon them. They must hate my father.
As the prime mover in the revolution which
exhibited their insignificance so palpably, they
will look upon the merchant as a person particularly
odious, and no doubt would gladly get
rid of him at any cost or risk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think for their own interests they
would let him alone;&rdquo; remarked his companion.
&ldquo;Experience ought to have taught them the
danger of meddling with so popular a character,
and having suffered so severely it is not like
that they will renew the hazardous experiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is because they have suffered that they
will be desirous of revenging themselves upon
one whom they consider as the cause of the
infliction;&rdquo; said Oriel. &ldquo;It would have appeared
bad enough to them if my father had been one
of the most powerful of the aristocracy; but it
wounds them to the quick when they reflect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
that he is a plebeian&mdash;in their ideas immeasurably
beneath them&mdash;an individual of
no ancient family, without rank or dignity.
With the feelings which a knowledge of this
fact must create it is impossible that they can
rest satisfied with their limited privileges and
curtailed power. They will be continually
intriguing for his destruction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They dare not do it, Oriel,&rdquo; replied Zabra;
&ldquo;I feel assured they dare not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could think so,&rdquo; said his patron;
&ldquo;but I have a little more knowledge of the
world than you, Zabra, and I know something
more of the disposition of such men. As long
as he lives they will consider themselves insecure.
They can know no peace save in his
death; and I am convinced that they will use
every exertion to accomplish it. I hope I may
be enabled to return in time to frustrate their
intentions. I should like nothing better than
to expose their machinations, and to punish
them in an appropriate manner; and if the
people exist in the same state of feeling as
when my father last wrote, I will show them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
something they little expect to see. My father&rsquo;s
friends are almost innumerable in Columbus,
and are always ready with hand and heart to
serve him whenever he will give the word,
which he is always exceedingly loth to give;
and I think I may say that my friends in the
metropolis are neither despicable in number nor
in influence, and are as eager to befriend me in
time of need; and I shall be quite as eager to
accept their services. I remember the times
when I have been exercising my regiment, the
devotion that was displayed by both officers
and men; but this I am well aware was owing
to their admiration of my father&rsquo;s virtues. Of
them I am secure. My fondness for military
exercises made me labour to perfect in discipline
the troops I commanded, and they are now as
effective a body of men as ever entered a field
of battle. They will perform good service
wherever they go. The national guard is
another powerful engine to be employed on
such an occasion. In the metropolis alone
they amount in number to about twenty thousand;
and they are devotedly attached to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
father. If there exist but a sufficient cause
I know that I have only to present myself
amongst them, to induce them to follow me
wherever I choose to lead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust you will have no occasion for their
services,&rdquo; said his companion; &ldquo;it is my belief
that on our return we shall find every thing
in the most comfortable state, and all parties
satisfied with each other. Your military dreams
will then be completely disappointed, and you
will be under the painful necessity of making
up your mind to share the well-earned honours
of your father, and partake of a perfect state
of happiness with Eureka.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Eureka!&rdquo; exclaimed the young merchant
with passionate emphasis; &ldquo;how rejoiced
I shall be to return to her! I often find myself
inquiring into the possibility of a change in
her disposition towards me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That can never be, Oriel;&rdquo; observed the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the fullest confidence in her fidelity,
but sometimes I find an apprehension intrude
without knowing what produced it;&rdquo; said his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
companion. &ldquo;There are no such self-tormentors
as your true lovers; and although I
should be among the first to laugh at the suffering
they give themselves, I must acknowledge
that on more than one occasion I have
endured a state of feeling which was any thing
but satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By what was it occasioned?&rdquo; inquired
Zabra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merely from my ignorance of the motives
which have induced her to deny me any communication
with her till my return;&rdquo; answered
Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would not condemn her if you knew
what made such a denial necessary;&rdquo; remarked
his young friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very probably not: but the mischief of it
is, I do <em>not</em> know;&rdquo; said Master Porphyry.
&ldquo;Any thing in the shape of a mystery annoys
me amazingly, and this behaviour of hers appears
to me most mysterious and unaccountable.
I think between lovers the most perfect
sincerity should exist. There should be no
room left for doubt or suspicion. But in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
generality of attachments you will find much
more deception than sincerity. In the affections
of youth there is an earnestness which is
the most natural and convincing that can be
conceived; but as the heart grows older, it
gradually loses all this admirable freshness and
purity, and in a few short years it has recourse
to artifices and disguises without number. I
detest deceit. I cannot imagine Eureka deceitful.
I hope never to find her so. To the
truly devoted&mdash;to one who finds no enjoyment
like that which proceeds from honoring his adored
as the truest, the purest, and the best, there
can be nothing so revolting as the discovery
that she whom he worships as one so pre-eminent
in goodness is the habitual practiser
of contemptible deceits, hides all her actions
under a cloak of elaborate artifices, and lives in
a spider-like existence, spinning a dirty web to
hide herself and betray her victims.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eureka is of a very different character;&rdquo;
observed Zabra, who during the preceding observations
had appeared exceedingly confused.
&ldquo;She has not deceived you in any thing which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
it was requisite for you to know. She detests
artifice as much as you do. But there are
always some things which the most sincere may
find it necessary to conceal. The truth cannot
be spoken at <em>all</em> times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might just as well say that good
money ought not to be passed at all times;&rdquo;
said Oriel Porphyry. &ldquo;That which is good
ought to be good upon all occasions, and truth
is the very best of things in social intercourse.
It is the sterling coin of the affections; and she
who uses base counterfeits deserves the ignominy
with which such vile cheating should be
punished. I have the very highest opinion of
the female character, and I desire always to
think highly of womankind; but taking the
sex generally, I do sincerely think that they
are amazingly fond of disguising the truth as
much as possible. It is a crooked policy&mdash;a
policy that in time poisons every better feeling
a woman can possess. Deception and a love of
general admiration are her prevailing vices. I
am well aware that they are thought very
innocent little foibles by those who practise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
them, but on that account they are not the
less destructive to feminine excellence. Love
is a passion of one for one only. It ought to
be excited by one object, and conferred on one
object alone. And thus exhibited, it is the
purest, the most graceful, and the most natural
of human emotions. If either party introduce
another as a sharer in the affections, the whole
feeling becomes tainted. What can be more
unjust to the lover who concentrates all his
hopes on the exclusive possession of the affections
of the object of his fond idolatry, which
hopes have been called into existence by fond
avowals and delicious caresses, than for the
woman whom he thus regards, to be just as affectionate
in her manner to a second, a third, a
fourth, a fifth, and a sixth? Some women seem
to pride themselves on the number of their
admirers. What a miserable vanity it is! It
is exactly the same feeling with which an
Eastern monarch used to regard the number
of females in his seraglio. Imagine the state
of mind produced in a man of refined intellect
and delicacy of feeling at discovering that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
lips he thought sacred to his caresses were
defiled by the caresses of another! Or if she
allow others merely to continue to profess to
her their ardent admiration, she evinces a
neglect of the unalterable law of the affections,
which ought to be punished by contempt,
scorn, and disgust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But no woman ought to be accountable for
the admiration she may excite;&rdquo; observed Zabra.
&ldquo;The most virtuous woman may without the
slightest intention create an unhallowed passion
in one of the opposite sex.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women are remarkably quick sighted in
every thing connected with the affections;&rdquo; replied
the young merchant. &ldquo;They can discover
the earliest signs of admiration, and every truly
virtuous woman, if her sympathies are pre-engaged,
will endeavour to crush this feeling in
the bud, and show, by her displeasure and
avoidance of the object, that he has created no
reciprocal emotion. If after such passion is
declared she continue to tolerate the attentions
of her admirer, although she be virtuous in
other respects she has no conception of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
nature of perfect virtue. She is fostering an
illicit feeling; she is encouraging a passion she
has no intention of indulging&mdash;a crime the
most destructive in its effects upon the happiness
of the individual whose passion she encourages;
and as it is vicious in its tendency,
because it aims at indulgence at the expense of
virtue, and as she assisted in its developement
instead of destroying it in its early growth, she
is answerable for all the consequences that may
arise from its existence, and has deserved the
censure of being considered vicious in her disposition.
Toleration creates hope, and hope
will love through all difficulty; but no man,
unless he be a fool or a knave, will love in utter
hopelessness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely these observations can have no
relation to Eureka!&rdquo; exclaimed Zabra earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest;&rdquo; replied his patron.
&ldquo;She is all I would wish her to be; and the
only cause of uneasiness she has given me
during our attachment is this mystery about
the place of her concealment, and her avoidance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of any communication with me for so long
a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your uneasiness will soon be removed, then,
and the mystery will be explained in a manner
that will perfectly satisfy you;&rdquo; said the youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so;&rdquo; exclaimed his patron. &ldquo;But
I certainly do not like being mystified by those
in whom I take an interest. Mysteries, however,
seem most abundant around me just now.
There is something very strange and unaccountable
in you, Zabra.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me! in me, Oriel?&rdquo; replied his companion,
in evident confusion. &ldquo;What can there be
strange or unaccountable in me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have noticed many things in your behaviour
exceedingly extraordinary;&rdquo; said the
young merchant. &ldquo;Your superiority to the
situation in which you were introduced to me
has often made me imagine that you are not
what you assume to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not what I assume to be!&rdquo; exclaimed
Zabra in increased embarrassment. &ldquo;Is it possible
I can be any thing else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is best known to yourself, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
her who sent you,&rdquo; replied Oriel Porphyry;
&ldquo;but there certainly is a mystery about your
character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mystery! how strange you should imagine
such a thing;&rdquo; responded his youthful companion,
attempting to conceal his confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s my father, he has <em>his</em> mystery,&rdquo;
continued his patron; &ldquo;it is some secret
connected with that wretched aristocrat Philadelphia,
but what it is about he is not inclined
to communicate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have noticed it,&rdquo; said Zabra, recovering
from his confusion; &ldquo;and I imagined it to be a
knowledge of some circumstances connected
with my father&rsquo;s early life, the publication of
which would do him very serious injury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say what it is, but these things
are very perplexing,&rdquo; observed the young merchant;
&ldquo;however, I hope to make my way
through them on my arrival at Columbia. How
glad I shall be to see its glorious shores again!
Nothing is so likely to excite patriotism as
exile; and Columbia is a country worthy of
one&rsquo;s patriotism; the first nation of the world;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
its citizens have reason to be proud. I have
beheld during my voyage many lands and many
people, but I have seen neither land or people
to be compared to Columbia and its inhabitants.
I rejoice that I am returning to them, and
though I am glad that this voyage is nearly at
an end, I hope that my father will be gratified
with my proceedings during my absence; and
then if Eureka&rsquo;s sentiments in my favour have
not undergone any change I shall have nothing
to fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of Eureka&rsquo;s constancy you will soon be
convinced;&rdquo; said Zabra, in a more subdued tone
than he had previously used.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be delighted to find it so. But
do you think that she would have no objection
to protect the gentle Lilya?&rdquo; asked
Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None whatever;&rdquo; replied his companion.
&ldquo;I am sure she will be much gratified by your
suggestion of such an arrangement. Lilya is
timid and perfectly ignorant of the world, yet
she is docile and affectionate, and with proper
management I have no doubt she would become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
an amiable and accomplished woman,
qualified to adorn any rank in society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The creature is so shy that I can scarcely
ever get a glimpse of her,&rdquo; observed his patron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is almost always with me,&rdquo; said the
other; &ldquo;every thing appears to be new to her
on board the ship, and her pleasure at the novelties
she beholds is so genuine that it is delightful
to see her. She requires a companion,
or she would feel quite alone amongst us; and
I being about her own age, she naturally feels
more at ease with me than with any other.
Her diffidence is excessive; I cannot get her to
associate with any one except myself; but I
have no doubt that in time she will gain confidence,
and join us in the cabin or on the quarter-deck
with perfect self-possession. She seems
remarkably fond of music, and appears to enjoy
nothing so much as hearing me sing to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care, Zabra;&rdquo; said the young merchant,
with a smile. &ldquo;An ancient poet has
said that music is the food of love. The harmony
of sweet sounds, breathed around two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
such hearts as yours and Lilya&rsquo;s, will be sure
to put them in unison. If you go on in this
way, existing in a state of such intimate communion,
it will be utterly impossible for either
of you to resist the soft influence of the tender
passion, and you have both of you arrived at a
time of life when the disposition is peculiarly
susceptible to its impressions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no fear of such feelings being
created, I assure you;&rdquo; replied Zabra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me very probable,&rdquo; observed
Oriel; &ldquo;your being so much together is sufficient
to produce such an effect. Besides, she
is so very pretty. What a depth of tenderness
there exists in the soft blue of her beautiful
eyes! and her smile is positively exquisite.
The rich bloom of her complexion reminds me
of some delicious fruit, it is so warm, and soft,
and tempting; and then the expression,&mdash;so
innocent, so artless, and so bashful, it is absolutely
enchanting. I must not forget her
graceful figure, it is worthy of the highest
eulogium for being so delicately rounded. I
am glad she has not thrown aside her dress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
skins and feathers, for, in my opinion, its simplicity
and picturesqueness would put fashion
out of countenance. I never behold her, whenever
she does venture into my presence, but I
imagine her to be the Psyche of the heathen
mythology, or some other amiable character in
that system of dreams:&mdash;the object of devotion
to the immortal youth, or the rosy cup-bearer
to the gods. I assure you, I admire her very
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Zabra, who had listened
to these praises of Lilya in evident
uneasiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she has interested me very deeply;&rdquo;
replied Oriel. &ldquo;I am charmed at the gentle
being who has been so unexpectedly thrown
on my protection. I feel delighted at being
able to gratify her unambitious wishes; and
when she comes shrinking into my presence, like
a delicate flower before the breeze, nothing
pleases me so much as endeavouring to assure
her of her safety. And then the simple creature
is so grateful, and thanks me with such
looks, that there is no resisting them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Zabra&rsquo;s eyes gleamed restlessly, his lips became
pale, and his cheeks bloodless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could see her more frequently, and
she would be somewhat less reserved;&rdquo; continued
his patron. &ldquo;It is so difficult to get
her to converse; yet her voice is so subdued
and melodious that it is a pleasure to hear her.
It is seldom any thing beyond a murmur. She
never attempts to raise her voice into a more
audible sound. She seems as if she was afraid
of hearing herself speak. After having been
used to the affectations and hypocrisies of
female society, the artlessness of Lilya&rsquo;s conduct
and the purity of her nature becomes
exceedingly refreshing: I certainly do admire
her very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zabra, as if unable to conceal the emotions
that were evidently producing a most powerful
effect upon him, with a look of indescribable
anguish hastily left the cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel Porphyry,
astonished at the sudden departure of his young
friend. &ldquo;He must love her. I am certain from
his appearance while I was speaking in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
praise, that he loves her, and is jealous of
the admiration I have expressed. How very
strange!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zabra hastened to the quarter deck, where
he sat himself down in a retired corner, apparently
in the most intense agony of mind.
His dark features were impressed with the
workings of a violent passion; his lustrous eyes
shone with a brilliancy that was vivid and piercing
to an extraordinary degree; and his breast
heaved with that full and rapid pulsation of the
heart which is the usual effect of great excitement.
Covering his face with his hands, he
continued in that position for several minutes.
&ldquo;That it should come to this!&rdquo; he muttered in
a voice tremulous with emotion. &ldquo;That it
should come to this! What a reward for all
I have done and suffered! Oh agony insupportable!&mdash;Oh
misery scarcely to be endured!
Where will the devoted heart meet with fidelity?
Where will the loving one, who feels and thinks
and acts with no other desire than for the happiness
of the loved, meet with a like regard?
The dream is over&mdash;the delusion is passed&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
hope which has led me on seems utterly
extinguished. But perhaps it may not be&mdash;I
may be deceived in my suspicions. It would
look like injustice to condemn him without a
more perfect knowledge. I will observe them.
But he said how much he admired her; he said
it to me!&mdash;Ah! it must be true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zabra was impatiently starting from his seat
when he beheld Lilya standing before him with
every appearance of deep concern in her countenance;
he suddenly snatched her by the arm,
drew her towards him, and gazed in her face
with a fierce and searching look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you gaze on me thus?&rdquo; inquired
Lilya, shrinking from the stern scrutiny to
which she was being subjected. &ldquo;Why is
your look so dark? He whom I used to call
my father never looked thus on me, and you
never so regarded me before. Have I done
any thing wrong, by which I could offend you?
How sorry I shall be if I have! Or are you
ill? Let me endeavour to make you better:
I know where grow the healing herbs and the
balmy plants that are good for many different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
maladies. Let me gather them and make you
a drink such as may restore you to health; or
shall I run down the young leveret or snare the
tender woodpigeon to procure you delicate eating?
Ah me! I forgot that I am not where
either herbs or plants, or leveret or woodpigeon
are to be found, but on the wide waste of sea,
where neither green moss nor twining ivy, nor
flowers, nor trees, nor any leafy thing exists.
But what can I do to make you better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I believe you?&rdquo; asked her companion,
relaxing in some degree in the severity of his
gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can if you like, Zabra,&rdquo; replied the
simple girl; &ldquo;and I do not see why anyone
should not believe me, because I always speak
the truth; and why <em>you</em> should not believe me
seems so very strange. I always believe you. I
am sure you would not say any thing that was
not true, and I could not think of saying a word
with an intention of deceiving you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not seem like one inclined to be
treacherous;&rdquo; observed the youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw any one inclined to be treacherous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
therefore I cannot say whether I do or
do not look in that way,&rdquo; said the girl; &ldquo;but I
am not so inclined, that I am positive of, for
I have nothing in the world to be treacherous
about, and it is impossible that I should ever be
treacherous to you. Now, Zabra, you look more
like the good and kind being I have known you
to be. Ah! what a pleasure it is to listen to
you when you sing your delightful songs, or
speak to me so persuasively of virtue, and wisdom,
and excellence, and all such admirable
things. It makes me forget how much I loved
to watch the birds at their nests, and the young
kids at play; and hear the lark&rsquo;s song in the
morning, and the nightingale&rsquo;s at night. It
makes me forget all my favourite haunts
where the choicest flowers used to grow. It
makes me to forget all I once found so pleasant
to remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have noticed Oriel Porphyry, have
you not?&rdquo; inquired Zabra, fixing on his companion
a searching glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; replied Lilya eagerly; &ldquo;he that
is so noble looking. His eyes are so bright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and his hair curls over his forehead so beautifully,
and he looks so kindly at me when I see
him and talks to me so kindly, that I like him
very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt you do!&rdquo; exclaimed the youth,
with considerable bitterness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not been much with him, for I feel
quite afraid of him;&rdquo; continued Lilya. &ldquo;He
seems to me so very grand and proud in his
appearance, that I dare scarcely look at him
when we meet, and as for speaking I have
then neither voice nor words. But he appears
so good. He takes my hand in his, and he
presses it so gently, and he says to me such
encouraging things, and he looks upon my face
with so much earnestness, that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s palpable!&rdquo; cried Zabra, hastily
interrupting his companion, and regarding her
with a gloomy scowl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I cannot help feeling that I like him
very much; and, although I am afraid to utter
a sentence, he still continues his kindness, and
never lets my hand go from his. However, I
must try to tell him how grateful I am. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
very foolish of me, I believe, in not saying how
I feel towards him. But how you look at me,
Zabra!&rdquo; exclaimed Lilya, as she noticed the
dark and angry expression of her companion&rsquo;s
features. &ldquo;Is it displeasing to you that I do
not express the sentiments I entertain? I will
confess them. Are you angry because I do
not like him so well as I ought to do? I will
like him ever so much more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly, you are obedient!&rdquo; observed the
other, with sarcastic emphasis; &ldquo;a pattern
of one who is willing to please! There
cannot be a question about your dutifulness.
Dupe, that I have been not to see your artifices!
But who could have supposed that, under such
apparent artlessness, there lurked so much
treachery? Your deceit is well done. None
would suspect it. It is the most finished piece
of falsehood that ever was acted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Falsehood! Deceit! Treachery!&rdquo; exclaimed
Libya, astonished and alarmed by the violence
in the language and conduct of her companion.
&ldquo;What are such things to me, Zabra? I
know them not. They cannot be for me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
use. Oh, why do you look at me in so unkind
a manner? They are not the looks that make
me happy. I see you are angry with me, and
I know not for why. I must have done some
great wrong, or you would not behave to me in
a way so unlike what you have used me to.
And, indeed, I did not do it intentionally. I
would not have offended you if I could have
avoided it. What shall I do? Tell me what
I shall do to acquire your forgiveness, and I
will never repeat the offence again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you think that I will now believe
these professions?&rdquo; inquired her companion,
with considerable asperity. &ldquo;Do you think,
after having been once deceived, I would allow
myself to be the victim of the same deception?
Oh no! that can never be. You are discovered.
I know you thoroughly. Away
with you, and let me no more be made
miserable by your presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! alas! what heinous wrong have I
done?&rdquo; exclaimed Lilya, as the tears made
their appearance on her cheeks. &ldquo;I know
not what it is&mdash;I cannot imagine any thing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
unless it be my behaviour to Oriel Porphyry,
that offended you. I acknowledge he deserved
better treatment; but, if it be your desire, I
will immediately go and tell him all that I think
of him: and when he looks so kindly, and talks
so kindly, and presses my hand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Away, vile hypocrite!&rdquo; shouted Zabra, as
with looks of indignation and rage he pushed
Lilya aside, and rushed from the place. She
gazed after him without uttering a word. Her
spirit appeared quite overwhelmed; and all the
confidence she felt in his society completely deserted
her. The heart of the timid girl seemed
filled with a sense of desolation she had never
before experienced, and she sat down in the
seat he had vacated, and wept. Here she remained,
in the full consciousness of her unprotected
state, till the sound of approaching
footsteps made her hurriedly seek concealment
in some obscure part of the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Albatross is crossing the Atlantic in
very brilliant style, I think;&rdquo; observed the
young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, she does spank along pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
smartly,&rdquo; replied the captain. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s utterly
impossible for a better bit o&rsquo; timber to be found.
She&rsquo;s been tried in all sorts o&rsquo; weathers, in all
sorts o&rsquo; seas; and no matter whether we were
doubling the Cape, or beating about in that ere
terrible monsoon in the Bay o&rsquo; Bengal, she
stood on her feet like a trump, and answered
to the helm as sensible as any born cretur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our passage home will be brief and pleasant,
I should imagine, from the portion we
have passed,&rdquo; remarked Oriel Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no knowin&rsquo; sir,&rdquo; said old Hearty,
seriously. &ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s fair weather and
sometimes it&rsquo;s foul, and sometimes it&rsquo;s a bit o&rsquo;
both. The weather&rsquo;s the most unsartaintest
thing in nature; it puzzles the wisest on us.
It&rsquo;s quite optional whether it has a mind to
blow one way or t&rsquo;other, and sometimes it
seems as if there was a reg&rsquo;lar blow up wi&rsquo; ev&rsquo;ry
wind as blows, and they gets a skylarking wi&rsquo;
one another most considerably.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very anxious to return to Columbia
with as little delay as possible,&rdquo; observed the
young merchant. &ldquo;My not having received any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
communication from my father, and my knowledge
of the unsettled state of the country,
makes me fear that the government have got
the upper hand again, and that they have made
my father the victim of their vengeance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They daren&rsquo;t harm him, sir,&rdquo; replied the old
man; &ldquo;they daren&rsquo;t harm a hair o&rsquo; his head;
they knows of old how popular he is, and how
popular he desarves to be; and they must have
a pretty considerable winkin&rsquo; that they&rsquo;ll be left
among breakers if they &rsquo;tempts to steer that
course. I arn&rsquo;t no great politician, but it&rsquo;s as
plain as a marlin spike to me, that if they bore
down upon master Porphyry after that fashion,
they&rsquo;d get such a broadside from the people as
&rsquo;ould sew &rsquo;em all up in their hammocks in very
little time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I shall arrive before they can execute
their evil intentions, if such intentions
they have,&rdquo; remarked Oriel. &ldquo;In case I should
require their services, do you think I could depend
on the crew of this ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On ev&rsquo;ry mother&rsquo;s son of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said the
captain, with emphasis. &ldquo;Ev&rsquo;ry man in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
vessel&rsquo;s selected, and most ov &rsquo;em have sailed wi&rsquo;
me at some time or other. There arn&rsquo;t a braver
or more skilful crew afloat; and if &rsquo;tis required
that they shall bear a hand in defence o&rsquo; master
Porphyry, I&rsquo;ve got a notion there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo;
they&rsquo;d do wi&rsquo; half so much &rsquo;lacrity. Master
Porphyry ha&rsquo; done so much good in his time
that there&rsquo;s scarcely a cretur livin&rsquo; as has&rsquo;nt
through his friends or relations profited by it in
some degree, and it arn&rsquo;t in the natur o&rsquo; a seaman
not to be grateful. As for me, when I&rsquo;ve
had never a shot in the locker, master Porphyry,
more nor once, has made me comfortable inside
and out, and sent me afloat, laden wi&rsquo; summat
else besides ballast; and if I don&rsquo;t stand among
the foremost in any shindy as you&rsquo;ve a mind to
kick up, and don&rsquo;t sarve out the lubbers as
would be tryin&rsquo; to circumvent your honourable
old father, I&rsquo;ll give you leave to slice me into
pea-shells and dish me up into hogswash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly satisfied with your fidelity,
captain,&rdquo; said the young merchant, &ldquo;and I am
very much gratified by hearing that I can depend
upon the crew. There&rsquo;s no knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
what may happen, and you and your men
might render me service of the highest value.
If the struggle I anticipate is to be made,
every brave man will be an important acquisition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we could only get together all the craft
as master Porphyry possesses, scrunch me! if
we shouldn&rsquo;t be able to turn &rsquo;em inside out, wi&rsquo;
as much ease as a fellow might take in a reef,&rdquo;
exclaimed the old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That cannot be done without the sacrifice
of more time than I can spare,&rdquo; observed Oriel.
&ldquo;My great object is to arrive in the metropolis
before the government can find an opportunity
for working out its schemes, as I feel convinced
that they only wait occasion to resume the influence
of which they were dispossessed. If I
am in time to prevent their intrigues, I will
speedily take such measures as shall put it out
of their power to make any attempt of the
kind; and if the mischief should be done previous
to my arrival, I will make such a stir in
the country as shall shake them out of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
ill-got authority before they have had time to
exercise it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I maintain that the ancients greatly excel
us!&rdquo; exclaimed Fortyfolios in a loud voice, as
he approached the place where the captain and
the young merchant were conversing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I maintain quite the reverse, don&rsquo;t
you see,&rdquo; replied the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of their universities, their schools,
their royal academies of painting and music,
their royal societies for the advancement of
science, their extensive libraries, their galleries
of art, and the wonderful degree of perfection
they attained in mechanics,&rdquo; said the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for their universities,&rdquo; observed Tourniquet,
&ldquo;they distinguished themselves most
by their bigoted attachment to prejudices that
had long been exploded in every other part of
the community. They wasted a vast deal of
time and intellect in teaching all such knowledge
as was most unprofitable; and this was
what they called a classical education. It
consisted in making the student devote the
best portion of his life in learning one or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
languages which were never spoken by the
living, and in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred
could not be of the slightest advantage to
the learner. A facility in the making of Latin
verses, which had no pretension to the name
of poetry, was looked upon as evidence of great
merit; and he who could put together a few
sentences in Greek, unmarked by one original
idea, was regarded as a genius which his college
ought to be proud of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to affirm that the dead languages
are not worthy of study?&rdquo; inquired
Fortyfolios.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I affirm nothing of the kind, don&rsquo;t you
see,&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;I only maintain that
the time devoted to their acquisition in the
system of education pursued by the ancients
might have been more advantageously employed.
Both the teachers and the taught enslaved their
minds with the same shackles. What loads of
paper have been spoiled by the labours of some
learned blockhead on the Greek particle, or by
the annotations and interpretations of some
laborious trifles attempting to elucidate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
meaning of some obscure Latin writer. But
there is a greater mischief in this than the mere
worthlessness of what it produces. The exclusive
attention which is required to gain a
mastery over a dead language stifles the affections
and narrows the intellect. It makes
men egotists and bigots; ignorant, prejudiced,
proud, and quarrelsome. What was Bentley?
what was Parr? what was Johnson? what was
Porson? What were all who distinguished
themselves by such great talents in small things?
Were they temperate, or modest, or amiable?
moderate in their enjoyments, or inoffensive in
their behaviour? Were they not the very
reverse of these?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were great scholars,&rdquo; observed the
professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were great fools, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; said
the other sharply. &ldquo;A man who offends against
decency, who is quarrelsome and imperious,
knows not the respect he owes himself or the
courtesies which are due to society; and his
actions, if they are not crimes, must certainly
be follies. As for his wisdom&mdash;as for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
wisdom of the grammarian, or the mere number
of books comparatively useless, his is the
knowledge of a man who has lived all his life in
the narrow circuit of a little village; he may
know every brick in every house, and may be
familiar with the exact state and quantity of
every dunghill there to be met with: but take
him out into the open world, and he knows
nothing but the prejudices of the place from
which he came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That does not prove that the learning of
the ancients is unworthy of study,&rdquo; remarked
Fortyfolios.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are the ancients?&rdquo; inquired Tourniquet.
&ldquo;The English are our ancients, the
Romans were their ancients, the Greeks were
the ancients of the Romans, and the Egyptians
were the ancients of the Greeks: the Hindoos,
or the Chinese, were the ancients of the
Egyptians; and if we could look to a more
remote period, we should be sure to find a
people who also had their ancients. It is a
very strange idea of the world to expect to
progress by always looking back, don&rsquo;t you see.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
The learning of our predecessors may always be
worthy of study if it be superior to the learning
in existence; but it has been the system of
universities and public schools to concentrate the
attention of the studious upon the learning of
the ancients, to the neglect of a knowledge
more available and of far more practical
utility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is strange, then, that the public schools
and universities of the English should have
produced so many illustrious men!&rdquo; said the
professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I maintain that their most illustrious men
were not produced in the public schools, don&rsquo;t
you see,&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;Of philosophers,
Bacon, Hume, Hobbes, Berkley, Shaftesbury,
Dugald Stewart, and Hartley; of men of
science, Newton, Flamstead, Napier, Davy,
Priestley, and Black; of statesmen, Burleigh,
Clarendon, Wolsey, Cromwell, Raleigh, Temple,
Burke, and Pitt; of divines, Tillotson, Chillingworth,
More, Jeremy Taylor, Selden, and
Sherlock; of heroes, Hampden, Russell, Marlborough,
Clive, and Wolfe; and of poets, Shakspeare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Ben Jonson, Spenser, Goldsmith, Pope,
and Thomson; besides numberless others I
cannot now remember; attained their eminence
without any assistance from public schools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you equally condemn their royal
societies and academies?&rdquo; inquired Fortyfolios.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, so far as concerns their utility, don&rsquo;t
you see,&rdquo; said Tourniquet. &ldquo;Did their royal
societies ever produce a great man? What
eminent philosopher or distinguished man of
science did they ever create? And as for their
royal academies, when you can point out to me
the great painters and great musicians they
have given to the world, I will acknowledge
the benefit society has received from them, but
not till then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not to be expected that all institutions
will perfectly answer the end for which they
were designed,&rdquo; remarked the professor. &ldquo;The
object for which they were founded was wise
and admirable, and to a certain extent they
realise that object. They collect together the
talent in the country, and then as much as possible
make it known to the public.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They neglect much more talent than they
collect, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; replied the doctor;
&ldquo;and these being usually governed by a select
few who have no conception of such a thing as
impartiality, he is considered the greatest man
amongst them who possesses the most patronage.
But the manner in which superior intelligence
was regarded by the government of England
was exceedingly discouraging to men of genius.
They would lavish pensions upon profligates,
spies, political apostates, the tools of power,
and the slaves of intrigue; but the man who
strived to exercise talents from which his
country would derive a certain and lasting
advantage was left to struggle on without the
slightest assistance. Any person, however
ignorant, if he could manage by prostituting
his soul to every kind of meanness and chicanery
to scrape together a sufficient sum of money,
might aspire to the dignity of a title of honour;
and sometimes, but very rarely, the same title
was conferred upon a favourite painter or physician;
minds of the highest order were obliged
to be satisfied without any such distinction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
The pliant orator, the successful soldier, and
the ready lawyer were ennobled; but genius,
and virtue, and honour, and worth, such as
were developed in the wisest and best of men,
were not thought worthy of a regard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Notwithstanding all this, the literature, and
science, and art of England flourished till it became
the admiration of surrounding nations,
and excited the wonder of each succeeding generation,&rdquo;
observed the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which proves that neither universities, nor
public schools, nor royal societies, nor academies,
nor artificial distinctions, such as existed in
England, were of any advantage in increasing
the intelligence of the people, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo;
added his companion. &ldquo;All such institutions
might be rendered highly serviceable to the
state; but the system upon which they were
conducted was so faulty, their government so
illiberal, and their influence so ineffective, that
I cannot conscientiously afford to give them any
praise, as they existed among the ancients.
As for their extensive libraries, on what principle
could a government defend the policy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
not only withholding from men of genius the
patronage they ought to afford them, but robbing
every author of several copies of every
book he produced without the slightest recompence&mdash;merely
for the purpose of augmenting
their libraries? The wealthiest state then
existing was guilty of this meanness. The
philosopher might exist as he could&mdash;starve&mdash;die&mdash;rot&mdash;in
any obscure hole in which he
could find refuge, without attracting the least
attention: but immediately his works were
published&mdash;no matter how expensive they were
to him, or how much labour and suffering
they had cost him&mdash;down came a demand
for eleven copies for the public libraries, for
which the author never in any shape saw a
consideration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the author had proper protection for
his publications,&rdquo; said Fortyfolios.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind,&rdquo; replied the doctor;
&ldquo;the law of copyright, as it was called, then in
existence for the protection of authors in the
sale of their works, was the most bungling
atrocity that ever originated in a legislature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
An author was allowed to possess his property,
the product of his own labour, <em>only</em> for a certain
time. Any man might leave to his heir
the land he had received from his father&mdash;any
man was allowed to bestow on his child the
wealth that he possessed; but the children of
the man of genius could not inherit any right
in the acknowledged property of their parent.
After the term had expired in which he was
allowed to possess his own&mdash;think of their
generosity in allowing this!&mdash;his labours might
enrich any one who chose to make them profitable,
and he and his children, and his children&rsquo;s
children, were left to starve. The man who
writes a book which acquires a certain value
by publication, has as much right to consider
all the profits it may produce as belonging to
him and to his heirs for ever, as is the man
who becomes possessed of land or other property
entitled to continue it in the possession
of his family from generation to generation:
and it is nothing better than an act of robbery
for any government to deprive either of a right
to which they have so perfect a claim.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have said nothing about the perfection
to which they carried their machinery,&rdquo;
said the professor. &ldquo;I think the ancients deserve
our thanks for their mechanical inventions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot confer praise on any invention,
however brilliant it may be, that must come
into operation at the expense of human sufferings,
don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; observed the other; &ldquo;and
all those machines which were brought into
use for the purpose of diminishing the amount
of manual employment, did produce a very
great degree of human wretchedness. It may
be very satisfactory to some parties, to consider
that the country becomes more wealthy
according to the increasing facility with which
its manufactures are sent to market; but the
time must come, if this rapidity of creating
produce continue, when the supply must exceed
the demand, and then finding an inadequate
market for its manufactures, the country must
become poor. But while this result is gradually
brought about by the manufacturers
endeavouring to produce their goods by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
of machinery, at as little cost and with as great
facility as it is possible to attain, the thousands
who gained their subsistence by the labour
which these machines have supplied, are left
without a resource; they must crawl out the
remainder of their miserable lives as they can,
and are left to famish, to beg, or to steal. It
is pleasant, perhaps, to know that machinery
allows you to purchase half a dozen pairs of
shoes at the price you formerly paid for one,
but while every one can get shoes for a trifle,
they who make them can neither get shoes
nor bread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you still arguing, gentlemen?&rdquo; inquired
Oriel Porphyry as he returned from
another part of the ship to which he had
proceeded with the captain on the approach
of the philosophers. &ldquo;There certainly must
be a great fascination in your method of reasoning,
or you would either be tired of talking,
or want subjects to talk about. What has been
the matter in debate on this occasion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have been arguing upon the superiority
of the ancients over the moderns,&rdquo; replied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
professor. &ldquo;I maintained and do still maintain,
that the ancients far exceeded us in
intelligence, in skill, and in every thing which
is a sign of superior civilisation. Their works
of learning are invaluable&mdash;their efforts in
art not to be surpassed&mdash;their discoveries in
science have been the admiration of every succeeding
age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what says the doctor to this?&rdquo; inquired
the young merchant. Fortyfolios looked
round, and discovered that his antagonist had
left the field.</p>

<br />
<span class="f8">LOVE MISPLACED.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Zabra&rsquo;s</span> disposition appeared to have undergone
a complete change. He was no longer to
be found in the cabin delighting every one
with the stirring eloquence of his language, or
on the quarter-deck instructing the gentle
Lilya in the wonders of the ship. Instead of,
as had hitherto been the case, seeking the
company of Oriel Porphyry as the greatest
enjoyment he possessed, he had for several
days avoided every place where they were
likely to meet. He roamed about the vessel
without attempting to converse with either
officers or crew, and if any one ventured to
address him, the proud look with which the
speaker was regarded, as the young creole
turned away, was sufficiently repulsive to prevent
the experiment being repeated. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
those with whom he had used to be on terms
of intimacy, the captain and the young midshipman,
were passed by with the same gloomy
look. Every one wondered at the change, and
all were ignorant of the cause.</p>

<p>Oriel more than once sought him for the
purpose of inquiring the reason of his strange
conduct, with the intention of endeavouring to
induce him to return to his usual place, as his
friend and companion; but the youth fled
from his approach so determinedly, and treated
his messages with such a studied neglect, that
the young merchant, imagining that Zabra was
in one of his mysterious moods, at last abandoned
all intention of interfering, expecting
that in a day or two he would become more
reasonable, and join in the cabin circle as
usual. Oriel Porphyry had observed so much
in the behaviour of his friend that was extraordinary,
that he had ceased to be surprised
by the strange way in which he frequently
acted. His conduct, therefore, in this instance,
did not excite in him any particular attention
or remark. But no one appeared to regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Zabra&rsquo;s unsocial manner with so deep an interest
as Lilya. She felt severely his estrangement
from her society: all her pleasures
seemed to be completely annihilated by his
absence. It was evident that his kind attentions
had not been lost upon her grateful
disposition, for she was too artless to disguise
her feelings, and her sentiments in his favour
seemed too evident to be misinterpreted. His
handsome features, so warm and eloquent in
their expression&mdash;his lustrous eyes, shining
with so soft a light&mdash;and his youthful figure,
so buoyant and elastic, had from the first
awakened in her breast a feeling of surprise
and admiration that was both strange and
delightful. A new world seemed rising before
her eyes. She entered into a different state of
existence. All around her breathed an atmosphere
of happiness that made her previous
pleasures appear dull and cold; and then she
found no enjoyment except in being near him,
and when he kindly endeavoured to lead her mind
to the contemplation of such subjects as were
likely to interest, to amuse, and instruct her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
simple nature, as the fire of youthful enthusiasm
shone in his brilliant gaze, and his
intellectual countenance kept changing its
expression in accord with the different feelings
which the subject created, she held her breath,
as if she thought that there was something in
what she saw that the least disturbance would
destroy; and hung upon his words as if there
was a charm in their sound which, once destroyed,
could never be created again.</p>

<p>In the lessons with which he sought to
enlighten her untutored intellect, her feelings
had participated. Her timid nature acquired
confidence in his presence. She more frequently
sought than shrunk from his society;
and she forgot that she was alone upon the
world without a single connecting tie to associate
her with its sympathies. It was from
such feelings as these that she was first disturbed
by Zabra&rsquo;s unaccountable and unkind
behaviour. In vain she endeavoured to find a
reasonable cause for such conduct in any thing
she had done; she knew nothing in which she
could have offended, except in not having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
appeared sufficiently grateful to Oriel Porphyry;
and this fault of hers she reflected on
so long, that she began to regard it as something
particularly heinous, and became daily
more desirous of attempting, by a different
behaviour, to repair the wrong she had committed.</p>

<p>She strived as much as possible to get rid of
her natural bashfulness, and sought out the
young merchant with the design of repairing
her fault in the best way she could. After
considerable hesitation and frequent desire to
turn back as she proceeded, she ventured as far
as the cabin door; where, after waiting a considerable
time, daring neither to go on, or to
return, she knocked gently. A voice kindly
bid her come in, and with a palpitating heart
she opened the door and entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Lilya!&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel, who sat
alone studying a book of military exercises,
&ldquo;this is an unexpected pleasure.&rdquo; Then
hastening towards her with a smile of welcome,
he led her blushing and trembling to the sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you will not any longer be such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
truant as you have proved yourself,&rdquo; said the
young merchant, kindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I been a truant?&rdquo; asked the timid
girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes you have, and a very sad truant
too,&rdquo; replied Oriel Porphyry, with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How sorry I am!&rdquo; murmured Lilya,
looking deeply concerned, though she knew not
what wrong she had committed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I will forgive you if you will promise
not to repeat the offence,&rdquo; said Oriel.
&ldquo;You must let me see you more frequently.
It is not kind of you to absent yourself from
your best friends. Remember that in me you
will always find a friend ready to do any thing
that is likely to insure your happiness. Will
you promise me, that you will not keep away
from me as you have done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will forgive me, I will promise
any thing that is proper for me to do,&rdquo; replied
the bashful maiden, appearing by her downcast
eyes afraid to look upon her companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will forgive you,&rdquo; responded
the other affectionately, taking one of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
hands in his. &ldquo;There can be very little
difficulty in my doing that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is something else,&rdquo; said Lilya,
trembling like a condemned criminal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else can there be?&rdquo; inquired Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something else for you to forgive,&rdquo; replied
the timid girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I was not aware of its existence,&rdquo;
responded the young merchant. &ldquo;Tell me
what it is. It will give me pleasure to forgive
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never told you how grateful I am
for your kindness to me,&rdquo; murmured his fair
companion in a voice scarcely audible. &ldquo;But
indeed I feel it. I cannot help seeing how
good you are, and&mdash;and&mdash;and I like you very
much for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are an admirable creature,&rdquo; exclaimed
Oriel Porphyry, apparently delighted with her
unaffected simplicity; &ldquo;and it will be a great
source of pleasure to me to be able to assist in
creating your happiness. As for gratitude,
there is no necessity for that, at any rate, at
present; but when I have succeeded in insuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
you all the blessings I wish you to enjoy, you
may be as grateful as you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you forgive me for my neglect?&rdquo;
asked Lilya, looking up to his face imploringly,
and then instantly casting her eyes to the
ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive you!&rdquo; cried her companion kindly,
&ldquo;you have committed no fault. But if it be
any satisfaction to you to receive my forgiveness,
it is readily granted; indeed, I feel so
much pleasure in conferring it, that I hope you
will very soon either commit the same or a
similar fault, that I may be allowed the same
enjoyment I now possess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I will not do so again, because that
would be wrong,&rdquo; observed the bashful maiden;
&ldquo;I should be unworthy of your kindness
if, after you had once been so good as to forgive
me for a fault I had committed, I committed
the same fault again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In truth, you are a most admirable creature,&rdquo;
exclaimed the young merchant, with
impressive emphasis. &ldquo;But what can I do to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
make your stay in the ship more endurable.
Your being used to roam at will over the wide
fields and open valleys of your native land,
must make this voyage appear very tedious.
I should like to vary its monotony for you as
much as possible. Have you a desire for any
pleasure I can gratify?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lilya looked confused, the colour in her face
disappeared and returned, and she tried once
or twice to raise her eyes from the ground to
the face of her companion; but as soon as she
had elevated them about half way, she let them
fall, and seemed as if she had not courage to
make another effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t answer me, Lilya,&rdquo; said Oriel
Porphyry. &ldquo;Do not be afraid of asking for
what you require. I wish your time to pass
as pleasantly as I can make it, and you will
afford me gratification as well as yourself by
giving me an opportunity for increasing your
enjoyments. Tell me what it is you most wish
to be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish Zabra would be as he used to be,&rdquo;
exclaimed the simple girl, and an expression of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
sadness became visible upon her beautiful
features.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; replied the young merchant;
&ldquo;but I have done every thing to induce him
to become so, without success. I cannot tell
what it is that makes him act so strangely; but
he is a strange creature at all times, and as I
have allowed him to do as he pleases, I am
afraid nothing I could say or do would make
him become more rational. He avoids every
attempt I have made to prevail upon him to
take his place amongst us as usual, and I have
therefore no remedy now but patience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He never used to be so,&rdquo; murmured
Lilya.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He appears to have taken offence at something
or somebody, but what the cause is I do
not pretend to know,&rdquo; said Oriel. &ldquo;I am
sure I have said or done nothing at which he
ought to have felt offence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought he was offended with me, because
I did not tell you how grateful I was for your
kindness,&rdquo; observed his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt that that is the cause,&rdquo; replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the other. &ldquo;But it is my opinion that, if any
one can bring him back to his former behaviour,
it is yourself, Lilya.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; exclaimed the blushing maiden;
&ldquo;I bring him back to be what he was! Oh I
wish I could!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you have only to try and there is
no doubt of success,&rdquo; remarked Oriel: &ldquo;Go to
him, be kind to him; tell him how much you
are afflicted by observing him abandon all his
friends, and assure him how happy it will make
you to see him exerting himself in the same
social offices in which he used to take delight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really think that would be of use?&rdquo;
inquired Lilya, as she raised her eyes till they
met those of her companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is not a doubt of it,&rdquo; replied he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will go this moment,&rdquo; she exclaimed;
and leaping from the sofa, she hastened
out of the cabin.</p>

<p>Zabra was alone bending over his harp and
striking a series of melancholy chords. He was
so completely lost in his own reflections, which
evidently from the gloomy expression of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
countenance were far from being pleasant, that
he did not observe the approach of Lilya. The
first notice he had of her vicinity was in feeling
his hand timidly laid hold of; and on turning
his head round, he beheld her gazing on him
anxiously and kindly close at his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What brought you here? Why do you
follow me? Is there no place where I can be
secure from your intrusion?&rdquo; were the quick
inquiries of the young musician, as with a stern
look he snatched his hand from the hold of the
timid girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I have no wish to offend you,
Zabra,&rdquo; said Lilya, feeling quite confounded
with the unfriendly reception she had met with.
&ldquo;I come to you, because I think you are unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who told you I was unhappy?&rdquo; asked
Zabra, sharply; &ldquo;and what is my unhappiness
to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is much, because it makes <em>me</em> unhappy,&rdquo;
replied the simple girl; &ldquo;and I thought you
were unhappy, because you have abandoned all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
your friends, and deprived me of the pleasure
you used to confer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not abandon them till they showed
themselves unworthy of my companionship,&rdquo;
said the youth proudly. &ldquo;Do you think I can
sit quietly to become the victim of deceit and
treachery? Do you imagine I can stand tamely
by while the heart I worship is ensnared by
another? No! I cannot endure it, and I will
not. I wish to be alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And will you not return to your place
among the friends who delight in your presence?&rdquo;
inquired the bashful maiden; &ldquo;they
are very anxious to see you. And I&mdash;I should
like you&mdash;I should very much like you to be as
you used to be; for then you were so kind, and
talked to me so delightfully, and appeared so
very happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was very happy then,&rdquo; exclaimed her
companion, in a voice tremulous with emotion.
&ldquo;I loved and believed myself loved in return.
But it is all over now; I have been deceived.
Go and leave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you did love, Zabra,&rdquo; murmured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Lilya without daring to move her eyes from the
ground, &ldquo;if you are sure you loved&mdash;I think
I&rsquo;m convinced&mdash;that is, I mean, that if you do
love, you must be loved in return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no! I saw it too plain,&rdquo; observed
Zabra. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beyond a doubt; it is evident&mdash;palpable&mdash;I
cannot be mistaken. Why do
you waste your time here? Have I not told you
I wish to be alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! do not look upon me so sternly,&rdquo; exclaimed
the gentle girl, with tears in her eyes;
&ldquo;indeed I wish to make you happy. I will
never offend you. I will be all you desire. I
will listen to you with the most perfect attention,
and carefully remember every thing you
tell me. Come, Zabra, come!&rdquo; she continued,
as she ventured tremblingly to lay hold of his
hand. &ldquo;Let me lead you to the kind friends
who are so desirous of your presence; let me
assure you that you are loved,&rdquo; she added, as
she raised the hand she held in her own to her
lips, and pressed them softly and quickly upon
it, and then, as if alarmed by her own temerity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
she hastily dropped it and stood blushing and
trembling by his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no! I tell you no! I am not loved.
I know it too well. Why do you come to me
with your affectionate words and fond endearments?
Take them to Oriel Porphyry; he can
best appreciate them,&rdquo; said her companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I will if you wish it, Zabra,&rdquo; replied
the simple girl. &ldquo;I would do any thing to
please you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt you would,&rdquo; exclaimed Zabra
sarcastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes I would, Zabra; and I will go this
moment and do what you require me:&rdquo; and
she had scarcely uttered the words before she
hurriedly left the presence of her companion.</p>

<p>Zabra sat alone at his harp, half doubting in
his mind whether it was simplicity or artifice
that Lilya had exhibited; but as he remembered
what both had confessed, he felt the
conviction that she was again endeavouring to
deceive him; and the miserable feeling thus
created he endeavoured to express in the following
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t allow you to sing such melancholy
ditties, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; exclaimed Dr. Tourniquet,
standing before the young musician,
where he had been for several minutes.
&ldquo;They make every body miserable and yourself
too; and besides this they are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
hurtful in their effects upon the system. They
are a sort of sedative that affect the head and
the heart at the same time&mdash;prevent eating,
drinking, or sleeping with any thing like a
healthy state of feeling. Allow me the privilege
of an old friend to ask you what&rsquo;s the matter
with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! it is a malady beyond the reach of
medicine!&rdquo; exclaimed Zabra mournfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s to be proved, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; replied
the doctor. &ldquo;I have for some days noticed you
running into holes and corners away from all
your friends. It is both unreasonable and unsocial.
I don&rsquo;t pretend to know what has
been the occasion of it; but as you have acquainted
me with your secret, I can make
a shrewd guess. Ah! this love&rsquo;s a terrible
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After having been assured you were beloved,&rdquo;
said the young musician; &ldquo;after
having convinced your own heart that your
affection was returned with the same ardour
with which it was given, to find doubt follow
doubt, till a certainty that you were not loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
gradually forced itself on your mind&mdash;this,
this is terrible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that cannot have been your case, don&rsquo;t
you see,&rdquo; exclaimed Tourniquet. &ldquo;You cannot
doubt&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing for you to dread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too true. I have been deceived,&rdquo; replied
Zabra, and his features became overcast
with a deeper melancholy. &ldquo;All that I have done
has been unavailing; all that I have dared has
been cast to the winds. To be the sole possessor
of one heart I thought would be a sufficient
recompense for all my past sufferings,
and dangers, and difficulties; but now I have
discovered the unwelcome truth, that another
has acquired the ownership of what I strove so
earnestly to gain. Oh shame on the treachery
that can allure a trusting soul into the conviction
that its sweet hopes are acknowledged and its
fond dreams replied to! and then, as a new face
or a more beguiling nature comes upon the
scene, will turn to it with a fondness which
should have been confined to the sincere one,
and leave all those hopes and dreams to be
crushed under the withering touch of despair!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager my professional skill you&rsquo;re
mistaken, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; said the doctor.
&ldquo;But who do you imagine to be the guilty
parties?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oriel and Lilya,&rdquo; replied his young companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; remarked
the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little older than you are,
and a better judge of character; and from the
result of my own observations, I feel certain
that neither of them are capable of such conduct.
Oriel Porphyry is noble, and is more
sincere in his character than any man I ever
met with; and Lilya is the most artless, shy,
unsophisticated creature that ever existed.
You must be wrong, don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both of them have acknowledged it to
me,&rdquo; said Zabra; &ldquo;both have confessed to
me their mutual regard. Yes, it is too true.
It is placed beyond the possibility of a doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without meaning any offence to you, I
can&rsquo;t believe it, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; said the doctor
good humouredly. &ldquo;You have been deceiving
yourself. There is a little bit of jealousy in
the case, depend upon it. And though I maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
that jealousy is usually a very reasonable
passion; for it is impossible for one who has
thought himself the owner of the affections of
another, to find a third party regarded as their
possessor, without feeling a considerable degree
of indignation: I think, in this instance, there
is no cause for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could think so! I most fervently
wish I could think so!&rdquo; exclaimed the youth
earnestly. &ldquo;Nothing could gratify me so much
as to find my suspicions unfounded; but the
facts are so clear that the most credulous would
be convinced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! lovers are the worst people in the
world to argue with, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; remarked
Tourniquet with a smile. &ldquo;They are always
convinced of something that no one else would
entertain for a moment. They believe without
a proof, and deny without a cause. With all
due respect for you, I must say that love is the
greatest folly upon earth. I don&rsquo;t mean to say
that I have not had my follies, don&rsquo;t you see;
for I have had a very fair share of them. I
remember my first folly of the kind very well.
I had commenced my medical education under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the auspices of an old uncle of mine. He was
exceedingly like all other uncles from the creation
of the world to the present time. He
was obstinate, peevish, domineering, and quarrelsome,
and was blest with a daughter, as all
uncles are that have a nephew to reside with
them. I was then a youth remarkable for the
pains I took in my clothes and in my personal
appearance; in fact, my dandyism was so conspicuous
that I was ashamed to look a dog in
the face for fear he should acknowledge me as
a puppy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All at once I thought it was highly necessary
I should be in love, don&rsquo;t you see; so I
brushed up my bits of whiskers, held my head
as high as I could, and looked about me. My
eyes quickly fell upon the charming Papaverica.
To be sure her hair was as much like
a bundle of scorched tow as it was possible to
be; but of course I called it an auburn. Her
nose was a lump of flesh; but of what shape it
would have puzzled a geometrician to decide;
yet I declared it was Grecian; and her mouth
<em>was</em> a mouth&mdash;there was no mistaking it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
it gave an openness to her countenance more
than usually expressive; and of course I swore
it was like two cherries seeming parted. Then
her body showed that she was somebody. It
might have been as thick as it was long, for its
length was nothing to brag of. As for her
feet, Papaverica was not a girl to stand upon
trifles. But whatever her figure was like, I
had no difficulty in convincing her it was the
very perfection of grace and beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fell in love. Papaverica was medicine,
surgery, and anatomy to me. The pharmacop&oelig;ia
was neglected, the vade mecum thrust
on one side. I forgot drugs and dressings,
lancets and laudanum. I had no taste for
mixtures, and my soul was above pills. My
thoughts were ever wandering towards the
charming Papaverica; and as it is not possible
for the mind to entertain two thoughts at the
same time, my labours in making up the medicines
for my uncle&rsquo;s patients occasionally produced
very strange effects. Potions and lotions,
cathartics and emetics, pills and squills, were
mixed together in what was not considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
&lsquo;most admired disorder;&rsquo; for my uncle&rsquo;s stick
spoke of any thing but admiration. But my
blunders were most conspicuous in writing the
labels. In giving the directions for a mixture
I was sure to write &lsquo;Papaverica, when taken
to be well shaken&rsquo;&mdash;for a draught, &lsquo;Papaverica
to be taken at bedtime,&rsquo;&mdash;and for a
lotion that had been repeated, &lsquo;Papaverica as
before.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this time we met, and made love after
our fashion, don&rsquo;t you see. Papaverica and I
looked at each other till we couldn&rsquo;t see out of
our eyes, and sighed like paviers at work on a
hard piece of ground. But her father tried to
put a stop to our proceedings; and if he caught
me talking to her, he gave me such a setting
down, or more properly, speaking, such a
knocking down, as gave me cause to remember
the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fathers have flinty hearts!&rsquo; said the sympathising
Papaverica.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And desperate thick sticks!&rsquo; I exclaimed,
with tears in my eyes, as I rubbed my aching
back against the door. However, this sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
thing could not go on for ever. I was sent to
pursue my studies at Columbus, and I lost
sight of Papaverica&mdash;I may add, for ever; for
she soon afterwards eloped with a strolling
actor who had been vagabondising in the
neighbourhood, and who had won her heart
by playing Romeo in a cocked hat and leather
breeches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My next folly was of a different kind.
I was a young student as fond of mischief as
any of the fraternity to which I belonged.
I was invited to an evening party, where
among the company, I noticed a young girl
with a laughing, dare-devil eye, and a person
remarkably smart. I inquired her name, and
from a friend learned all the particulars of her
history. Observing that she was regarding me
in a manner that told me that she was quizzing
me to her companions, I advanced, humming
an air till I came close before her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah Floss!&rsquo; said I, nodding familiarly.
&lsquo;Is it you? Haven&rsquo;t seen you this age.
You look particularly charming; and how is
your grandmother? Shouldn&rsquo;t suppose you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
half so old as you are, to look at you. And
has the cat kittened? I always admire your
style of dress&mdash;it&rsquo;s very becoming. So the
house dog&rsquo;s got well at last! Being an old
friend of the family, you must really make
room for me beside you.&mdash;How is your aunt&rsquo;s
toothach?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The girl at first stared at my impudence,
don&rsquo;t you see; but, finding I proceeded with
the same nonchalance, making all sorts of heterogeneous
remarks and inquiries, she laughed
heartily, in which she was as heartily joined by
her companions, and we became intimate in a
moment. We joked and romped in the most
provoking manner, and said the smartest things
of each other that could possibly be conceived.
I found that she lived with an aged grandmother
and an old maiden aunt, in a small
house in a retired part of the town. I watched
my opportunity when I saw the two old women
go out to take their evening walk, and gave
such a tremendous knock at the door that it
made the windows rattle again. As I expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
my charmer opened the door, and in I marched
as stately as an emperor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Halloo, sir, where are you going? This
is like your impudence, certainly!&rsquo; said she,
not knowing whether to be most offended or
amused at my behaviour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have come to honour you with a little
of my superfluous time, Floss,&rsquo; I replied in an
easy, condescending manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have, have you? then I shall just
thank you to make the best of your way back
again,&rsquo; she rejoined as she followed me into the
parlour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I shall do nothing of the kind, Floss, till I
please,&rsquo; said I, as observing some decanters of
wine on the table I began very quietly to help
myself; &lsquo;and I have the pleasure to drink your
health, Floss, and a good husband to you&mdash;when
you can get one.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You impudent jackanapes!&rsquo; she exclaimed,
as she observed me toss off a bumper. &lsquo;This
exceeds every thing I ever heard of.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I always strive to excel, Floss,&rsquo; I replied,
flinging myself at full length on a sofa. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
come here. Come to me like a good girl. I
have something to say to you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go to you! I&rsquo;ll see you farther first!&rsquo; she
cried, looking as disdainfully as she could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said I, rising and retreating a
few paces: &lsquo;now come to me&mdash;you see me
further.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t do any thing of the kind, Mr. Impudence,&rsquo;
she exclaimed, trying to hide her
laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then if you wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t come to me, I shall be
obliged to go to you, which is a great hardship,&rsquo;
I observed as I advanced towards her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you come near me I&rsquo;ll scratch your eyes
out!&rsquo; cried Floss, looking monstrously fierce;
yet I could easily see by the corners of her
mouth that she was very much disposed to
laugh, so I still approached.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you touch me I&rsquo;ll box your ears!&rsquo; she
exclaimed, beginning to look more serious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, Floss; you wouldn&rsquo;t
hurt a hair of my head, I know,&rsquo; said I, as I
attempted to insinuate my arm round her waist.
&lsquo;Ha, will you?&rsquo; she cried; and she gave me a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
slap of the face that made my teeth rattle in
my mouth like a box of cherry stones. I was
not to be easily driven from my purpose, so I
attempted to make good my hold, but immediately
received a box on the ear that made me
see all the colours of the rainbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t the heart to hurt a fly,&rsquo; said I
very coolly, while I endeavoured to throw my
left arm over her left shoulder, to get the command
of her arms; but in the execution of this
man&oelig;uvre, I received a shower of blows that
would have made a less eager lover than myself
glad enough to leave the field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What means this behaviour, sir?&rsquo; exclaimed
my charmer, endeavouring to look
expressively angry, and struggling with me
with all her might.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I mean to honour you so far as to kiss you,
Floss,&rsquo; I replied very quietly, though smarting
from the pain of the blows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll scream&mdash;I&rsquo;ll raise the house&mdash;I&rsquo;ll cry
murder&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m remarkably fond of music,&rsquo; said I, interrupting
her; and in a moment afterwards I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
had both her arms tightly pressed to her body,
and her face blushing and looking angry a few
inches beneath my own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never let you see me again as long as I
live&mdash;I&rsquo;ll hate you&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her mouth was stopped by mine, and every
time she attempted to speak I repeated the
same interesting ceremony, which she struggled
unavailingly to prevent; but with this revenge
I was not satisfied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let me go, sir; let me go this minute!
You wretch, don&rsquo;t you see how you&rsquo;re rumpling
my collar! Let me go, I command you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Before I do that I shall first allow you the
pleasure of kissing me,&rsquo; said I, with as much
condescension as I could assume.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kiss you!&rsquo; cried Floss, looking as savage
as an enraged turkey-cock; &lsquo;I&rsquo;d see you
hanged first!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll not go till you do,&rsquo; I replied, with
all the coolness imaginable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let me go, sir; your assurance is unbearable!&rsquo;
she exclaimed, making violent but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
ineffectual efforts to release herself from my
embrace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll not go till you kiss me,&rsquo; said I, as
calmly as possible. A loud knock at this moment
was heard at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let me go, sir. Here&rsquo;s my grandmother
and my aunt returned, and they&rsquo;ll abuse me
famously if they catch you here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll not go till you kiss me,&rsquo; I repeated
in exactly the same tone of voice I had previously
used. Another louder knock was now
heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There then, you plague!&rsquo; she cried as she
hurriedly pressed her lips to mine; &lsquo;and now
let me go.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Leave every thing to me, I&rsquo;ll manage the
old ladies,&rsquo; said I as I allowed her to escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s very strange, Floss, that you always
will keep us at the door so long when we knock,&rsquo;
mumbled the eldest of the two old ladies as
well as her want of teeth would allow her, as
soon as the door was opened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s very strange,&rsquo; remarked the other with
stronger emphasis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve spoken to you so often about it, that
I&rsquo;m quite shocked at your negligence,&rsquo; mumbled
the first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m quite shocked at your negligence;&rsquo;
echoed the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Goodness, a man!&rsquo; screamed out the
eldest, throwing her arms back, and nearly
pitching off her balance as she entered the
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Goodness, a man!&rsquo; squeaked out the
other in exactly the same tone, and with
exactly the same motion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May I be allowed to know the cause which
has conferred upon me the honour of a visit
from a perfect stranger, as it seems very extraordinary,&rsquo;
said the mumbler, advancing towards
me with stately steps, and scrutinising me
through her spectacles as if she would look
right through me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It seems very extraordinary,&rsquo; remarked
the other emphatically, as she also brought her
spectacles to bear upon my person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have I the honour of speaking to the
amiable and accomplished Mrs. Parrot-cum-Poodle?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
I inquired, advancing two steps with
a grave and respectful air, and making a bow
to the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am that humble individual,&rdquo; replied the
ugliest of the two, making a profound courtesy;
and then turning to her companion, she said
in a whisper, &ldquo;A very well spoken young
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very well spoken young man,&rdquo; echoed
the least ugliest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much have I reason to be gratified
with my good fortune;&rdquo; I observed, looking
as delighted as I could. &ldquo;I have travelled far
to procure it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a seat, my dear sir!&rdquo; exclaimed the
old one, with a look of sympathy that did not
make her look more agreeable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a seat, my dear sir!&rdquo; repeated the
other, in the same tone and manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Floss, why don&rsquo;t you give the gentleman a
chair?&rdquo; cried number one, sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Floss, why don&rsquo;t you give the gentleman a
chair?&rdquo; cried number two in a similar voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should prefer standing in the presence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
ladies for whom I have such perfect respect,&rdquo;
said I, with another bow equally profound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are too good!&rdquo; mumbled the first,
with something that was intended to be a
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are too good!&rdquo; muttered the other,
after the same fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come all the way from the village of
Parrot-cum-Poodle for the express purpose of
elucidating an important point in the pedigree
of the respectable and ancient family which still
bears the name of that distinguished place,&rdquo;
said I, with the gravest face I had ever made
use of. &ldquo;When the Parrot-cum-Poodles first
intermarried with the Tabbies, connected as
the Tabbies previously were with the Macaws,
one of the collateral branches of the Parrot-cum-Poodle
family; and the Macaws having
formed several alliances with the Pugs, I am
desirous of knowing what degree of consanguinity
the Pugs bear to the present descendants
of the ancient race of the Parrot-cum-Poodles,
because it is an inquiry of exceeding
interest, and one of the utmost value towards a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
right understanding of the family genealogy.
You must remember, that when the branch of
the Tabbies became extinct for want of heirs
male, there was a lineal descendant that could
trace his pedigree in a direct line up to the
first inheritor of the ancient name of Parrot-cum-Poodle;
but he being abroad at the time
when the title was declared extinct, knew nothing
of his legal claim to the honourable name
of his ancestors, and had a large family which
were brought up in perfect ignorance of their
relationship with the Tabbies. One of these
has lately married a remote branch of the Pugs:
now the descendants of this pair will stand in a
very extraordinary point of relationship to the
Parrot-cum-Poodles; and I should wish to
know where any of these descendants are to
be found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The oldest old lady had gradually opened
her mouth as I proceeded to show the labyrinth
of the Parrot-cum-Poodle genealogy, till it was
extended as far as it could stretch, and she
stared at me through her spectacles with as
complete a look of mystification as it was possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
to imagine, and was turning towards the
youngest old lady when she met a mouth
equally wide, and eyes equally mystified on the
point of turning towards her with the same
desire for explanation. All this time Floss had
stood behind them making the most desperate
efforts to swallow her pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However it is sufficient to say, that after
having bothered the old folks till they did not
know whether they were standing on their head
or their heels, I took my departure; and so
ended my second folly, for I never saw Floss
again. And now, having amused you, don&rsquo;t you
see, which is all I aimed at, I must insist upon
your going to Oriel Porphyry, and inquiring of
him whether there exist any reason for your
suspicions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try and do it,&rdquo; replied Zabra, in a
more cheerful tone than he had previously used;
&ldquo;and I hope it may be as you say.&rdquo;</p>

<br />
<span class="f8">A DISCOVERY.</span></h2>


<p class="noi">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">And</span> so you have no desire to live in the gay
world of fashion, Lilya?&rdquo; inquired Oriel Porphyry,
as they sat together on the sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand what fashion means,&rdquo;
replied the simple girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fashion itself is merely the way in which
a certain class of persons dress, think, speak,
and conduct themselves,&rdquo; said Oriel. &ldquo;And
the world of fashion is this exclusive class, with
all its gaieties, its frivolities, its prejudices, its
follies, and its crimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there is any thing wrong in it, I certainly
should not like to live there,&rdquo; observed
Lilya.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, not to partake of its brilliant
pleasures, of its balls, operas, concerts, dinners,
and fêtes?&rdquo; asked the young merchant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The things you mention I know nothing
of. Where do they grow?&rdquo; inquired his fair
companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do not grow, Lilya,&rdquo; replied Oriel,
with a smile; &ldquo;they are the amusements of
the world of fashion. A ball is a collection of
persons, or rather the amusement of a collection
of persons brought together for the purpose of
enjoying the diversion of dancing; and dancing
is a gliding motion of the feet, by which the
body is moved in different attitudes from one
place to another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do people amuse themselves in this
way; or is it an amusement for others to look
upon?&rdquo; asked Lilya.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the amusement in which both sexes
most delight,&rdquo; said the young merchant.
&ldquo;They meet together in rooms such as this
cabin, only much larger, and much more gay,
where music is provided; and directly the music
plays, they are all set in motion, and so continue
till the dance is over. Some dances consist in
whirling round, others in bounding forward, and
a great number in gliding from place to place.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think a ball would amuse me; I
should soon get tired of such exertion, especially
as I cannot perceive what causes the
amusement,&rdquo; said Lilya.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The amusement, I believe, is more generally
created by the persons who are brought
together than by any quality in the dance,&rdquo;
observed Oriel. &ldquo;But it is considered a
graceful and agreeable way of passing the
time; and, to young people particularly, it
appears to possess very great attractions. It
might be rendered a profitable exercise, but
the heat and glitter of a ball-room is not the
place in which it can be made most advantageous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather run after the leveret, or
chase the young deer for exercise,&rdquo; observed
the simple girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Operas and concerts are places where
fashionable people meet to hear music,&rdquo; continued
the young merchant. &ldquo;It is rarely
that the best music is played there; but, generally,
the best performers are there to be met
with.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather hear Zabra,&rdquo; exclaimed the
bashful maiden, hanging down her head as if
afraid the acknowledgment might not have
been proper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so would I a thousand times,&rdquo; replied
the young merchant, emphatically. &ldquo;For in
him we might be sure of finding something
like nature, which is not to be hoped for at
operas or concerts. As for dinners and fêtes,
they are merely for the purpose of allowing
people to eat and drink together, talk, stare,
push, squeeze, and elbow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I have no desire for any of these,&rdquo;
said Lilya. &ldquo;I do not perceive the pleasure
they would confer. I would rather be what I
am, than exist in a state such as you have
described.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that cannot be Lilya,&rdquo; observed Oriel,
kindly. &ldquo;I am going to put you under the
protection of a lady&mdash;of the lady whom I love,
Lilya. She is a beautiful, accomplished, and
amiable woman, of high family, and admirable
disposition; and, as she is obliged to find friends
and acquaintances in the circle I have pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
out to your attention, you must from the same
source derive all your social enjoyments; and
then you will be clothed in silks and velvets,
feathers and diamonds&mdash;will not that delight
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do these fine things make the possessor
happy?&rdquo; asked his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth Lilya, I do not think
they do,&rdquo; replied Oriel Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will have none of them,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;I know that I can be happy in
these humble skins that I have put together
with my own hands; but I know not that
I can be happy in the gay things to which
I am unused; and I would rather retain
what I possess, than give it up for an uncertainty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the Lady Eureka, with whom you will
stay, makes use of these things,&rdquo; said the
young merchant; &ldquo;and, unless you mean to
offend your best friends, you must do the
same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will wear them if my friends wish it,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
observed the simple girl; &ldquo;but I would rather
not, because I should appear so awkward in
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not fear that,&rdquo; exclaimed the young
merchant. &ldquo;You will not be allowed to wear
them till you know in what manner they should
be worn; and that you should look, and act,
and think, as becomes one who is the Lady
Eureka&rsquo;s friend. The most skilful masters in
every department of education will be provided
for you; and every endeavour will be made to
render you as elegant, intellectual, and agreeable
a woman as the world of fashion can
produce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will Zabra be there?&rdquo; inquired Lilya,
timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so. I&rsquo;ve no doubt he will,&rdquo;
replied Oriel Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I should like to be there!&rdquo; murmured
his fair companion, with marked emphasis on
the pronoun. &ldquo;And the Lady Eureka you
speak of&mdash;do you love her?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do, Lilya,&rdquo; replied the young
merchant, earnestly; &ldquo;and you will find her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
worthy of being beloved. She is beautiful,
good, affectionate, and intelligent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And does she love you in return?&rdquo; asked
Lilya.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my happiness to believe so,&rdquo; responded
Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How delightful it must be for both of
you,&rdquo; exclaimed the simple girl, with her face
beaming with animation as she turned her soft
blue eyes full upon her companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you shall share in this delight, Lilya,
if you prove yourself worthy of it,&rdquo; said Oriel,
kindly. &ldquo;Eureka is distinguished for her
superior excellence; and she cannot love you
unless you possess goodness to recommend you
to her. There is nothing in the world that a
woman ought so much to pride herself upon as
the purity of her actions. She ought not to
allow any one even to suspect her of wrong;
and if her behaviour is free from mystery or
deceit, she will never give cause for suspicion.
The first step towards the commission of great
criminality in a woman, is a carelessness in
tolerating familiarities from more than one, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
are not considered any thing beyond trifling
gallantries from the one by whom she is truly
loved; and from that one only can such things
be permitted, because in this instance they
become the natural signs of a sincere affection,
that are peculiarly graceful and refreshing in
their influence: but as the wife confines all
expressions of affection to her husband, so
ought the loved one to preserve all her devotion
for her lover. Their situations are exactly
similar; and &rsquo;t is as great a crime for a woman
to deceive her lover by allowing others to share
in her affections, as it is for a wife to betray
her husband by a violation of the marriage
vow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; said Lilya,
looking considerably puzzled and bewildered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I forgot it was to you I was speaking,&rdquo;
replied Oriel. &ldquo;But what I meant to express
to you is, that if you wish to insure and preserve
the good opinion of those whose good
opinion is most valuable to you, you will show
yourself particularly anxious to become distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
for excellence of conduct and goodness
of disposition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is just what Zabra has told me,&rdquo;
exclaimed the blushing maiden, &ldquo;He used to
be always talking to me in that way; and told me
so much that was proper for me to know, and
looked so kind, and appeared so attentive, that
I was always delighted to hear him. But he
no longer talks to me in that manner. He is
now harsh in his language, and stern in his
gaze; and he will scarcely look or speak to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you not been able to induce him to
return to us? I should have thought your
intreaties would have been complied with
immediately,&rdquo; said the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, no!&rdquo; replied Lilya, sorrowfully.
&ldquo;All my intreaties have been disregarded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you must allow me to make you forget
him till he comes to his senses,&rdquo; said Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I cannot forget him&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure I cannot
forget him&mdash;indeed, I cannot forget him,&rdquo;
exclaimed the artless girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He scarcely deserves to be so well remembered,&rdquo;
observed the young merchant. &ldquo;In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
fact I am beginning to feel angry with him for
being so obstinate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do not be angry with him!&rdquo; exclaimed
Lilya, earnestly; &ldquo;you must not be angry with
him, for I am sure he is unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, if I promise you not to be
angry, you must allow me to be as kind to you
as you would wish him to be,&rdquo; said Oriel
Porphyry. &ldquo;For I cannot suffer a creature
so unoffending as you are to be made wretched
by such unreasonable conduct. I shall regard
you as a favorite sister; and I feel just as much
interested in your happiness as if you were so
dearly related to me. I will not allow you to
have a wish ungratified that is harmless and
natural. I will endeavour to afford you whatever
pleasure you most delight in, that I have
the means of procuring; and I will watch over
you, and guard you from all evil, and shield
you from every danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how good you are!&rdquo; murmured the
gentle girl, raising her beautiful eyes, suffused
with tears, to his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I shall expect in return for all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
attention to your welfare, that you will regard
me with a sisterly affection,&rdquo; continued the
other. &ldquo;You must be as kind to me as I will
be to you. You must endeavour always to
appear cheerful and willing to be pleased.
Every effort that I make to render your life
an enjoyment to you, you must respond to by
showing the gladness it ought to produce.
You must be attentive to my instructions,
obedient to my wishes, be gratified with my
attentions, and satisfied with the exertions I
shall make to insure your happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I will!&rdquo; exclaimed the timid
maiden, affectionately clasping the hand of
Oriel in her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be a most pure and exquisite pleasure
to me to be allowed to labour in such a
good work as creating the felicity of so gentle
and innocent a creature,&rdquo; said the young merchant;
his noble countenance beaming with
benevolence. &ldquo;It will be a labour of which my
father would be proud; and to do as he would do
must always appear to me to be the highest degree
of excellence. It will be delightful to be loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
as a brother, and to show a brother&rsquo;s care and
anxiety and solicitude. It will be admirable
to be able to enjoy the sweet sympathies of a
nature such as yours, and to live in the enjoyment
of an interchange of endearments so
purifying to the heart as ours will be. I must
be loved Lilya. I will be as kind to you and
as careful of you as may be necessary for your
welfare; but I must be loved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I will love you;&rdquo; murmured his fair
companion, trembling and blushing she knew
not for why&mdash;&ldquo;I will love you as fondly as
you wish. I will love you kindly and affectionately.
I will love you always. I will be
at all times every thing you most desire me to
be. You shall never find reason to be dissatisfied.
I will not allow you to be unhappy:
all I do shall be done with the intention of
giving you pleasure. My heart is overflowing
with your goodness; and, indeed&mdash;and, indeed
I love you very much.&rdquo; With these words she
caught up the hand she had held in her own;
and eagerly, yet timidly, pressed it to her
lips!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Oriel Porphyry was so charmed by the simplicity
and genuine affection expressed by the
action, that he drew the bashful girl to his
arms, and pressed her lips to his own. This
had scarcely been done, when, on raising his
eyes, he encountered the full and piercing gaze
of Zabra. He stood before them,&mdash;his dark
features wearing an expression the most wild
and fearful&mdash;his breast heaving with passion,
and his whole frame trembling with the powerful
excitement under which he laboured. Lilya,
with an exclamation of surprise, shrunk into
the farthest corner of the sofa, and covered
her face with her hands. Oriel looked upon
him with astonishment, not unmixed with
wonder; for the extraordinary beauty of his
countenance, shrouded by its clustering black
curls, with the intensity of the expression
now impressed upon it, looked perfectly sublime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has it come to this?&rdquo; muttered the youth,
in a voice that seemed choked with emotion.
&ldquo;Has it come to this? The last hope I have
been allowed to entertain is now utterly crushed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Nothing remains but the conviction of my own
misery, and of your baseness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zabra!&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a reward is this you have given
me!&rdquo; continued the other, in the same hoarse
tones. &ldquo;What a recompense for all I have
done! Could you think of no way of showing
your appreciation of my devotion for you than
by destroying the dream of happiness I have
entertained? Have I not been faithful, and
attached, and willing, and affectionate&mdash;as
ready in the hour of danger to defend as desirous
in a time of pleasure to amuse? Did
I not share with you your anxieties, and rejoice
with you in every thing that gave you joy?
And yet you have committed this treachery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zabra!&rdquo; again exclaimed his patron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what have I failed to do you honour
and worship?&rdquo; still continued his companion,
slightly raising his voice as he proceeded. &ldquo;In
what have I been deficient? Where have I
offended? Have I not sought all times and
opportunities to fulfil your wishes before they
could be expressed? Has not my heart been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
ever anxious to assist in the realisation of your
best hopes? Is there any one thing you could
have wished me to do that I have not done?
If I had been slack in my exertions&mdash;if I had
been careless in my services&mdash;if I had been
heedless, thoughtless, or inattentive in my behaviour,
there might have been some cause for
depriving me of the affections which then I
should have been unworthy to possess:&mdash;but
I have exceeded all previous examples in the
exclusiveness of my devotion. I have dared
to do more than others could have imagined&mdash;I
have sought you out to watch over your
safety&mdash;and have served you with all honour,
and care, and kindness. Why&mdash;why have
you used me thus?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zabra, what madness is this?&rdquo; exclaimed
the young merchant, more surprised than offended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this is your love for Eureka!&rdquo;
continued the youth. &ldquo;This is the way in
which you return an affection, so deep, so
earnest, and so true as her&rsquo;s has been? Have
you lost all notion of justice, of virtue, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
that sincerity which most ennobles manhood?
Where is your sense of shame? What manner
of man are you, who, after you have been loved
in all earnestness, in all purity, in all exclusiveness,
and with all that self-abandonment which
is most conspicuous in the love of woman, can
turn round upon the object by whom you have
been so truly honoured, and cast her hopes to
the wind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zabra, you are proceeding beyond the
limits of endurance; and I shall be obliged
to acquaint Eureka with your unreasonable and
offensive conduct,&rdquo; said Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;<strong>I am Eureka</strong>!&rdquo; shouted the disguised
page, in a voice that made both her companions
leap from their seats with looks of the most
intense astonishment, as, with flashing eyes, and
words that seemed to breathe of fire, she exclaimed,&mdash;&ldquo;It
was Eureka who left her father&rsquo;s
house to escape from an alliance into which she
would have been forced had she remained.&mdash;It
was Eureka who forsook family and friends,
and the security and comforts of her own land,
to share the dangers and watch over the safety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
of one to whom she was so completely devoted.&mdash;It
was Eureka who quitted the dress and abandoned
the prejudices of womanhood, the more
securely to devote her disinterested heart to
the service of her lover.&mdash;It was Eureka who
dared with him the perils of the sea&mdash;rescued
him from the clutches of the pirate&mdash;stopped
the blows that were aimed at his life&mdash;shed
her blood in his defence; and, in all offices of
kindness&mdash;in all times of danger and difficulty&mdash;in
all moments of tranquillity and desire of
innocent enjoyment, thought only of his security&mdash;cared
only for his amusement, and
was anxious only for the perfect realisation of
his happiness. It was Eureka who did these
things: and I&mdash;I am Eureka!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Probably she might have continued the same
eloquent and forcible language; but the attention
of herself and of her lover were attracted
towards their companion. Lilya had listened
with the most breathless interest to the avowal
of the disguised Zabra; her eyes were fixed
upon the speaker in one continued stare&mdash;wild,
ghastly, and unnatural: the colour fled from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
her lips, the blood rushed from her face; her
breast heaved in quick, short, spasms, and
something was seen rising and swelling at her
throat. An expression of unutterable anguish
was impressed upon her beautiful features; she
made two or three choking gasps, and tottering
forward a few steps, fell at the feet of Eureka.</p>

<p>Oriel hurried to raise her from the ground;
gently he lifted her head, and exposed to view a
face pale as marble; the delicate mouth, half
open, and the fair blue eyes fixed and sightless.
As he attempted to take her hand, the head fell
back upon his shoulder.&mdash;She was dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eureka!&rdquo; exclaimed the young merchant,
in a voice husky with emotion, as he supported
the drooping corpse upon his arm, &ldquo;you have
wronged both her and me. She would never
have been regarded by me save as a sister; and
it was only with a brother&rsquo;s fondness that you
saw me caress her. I am deeply grateful to
you for the devotion with which you have
honoured me; but when I look here,&rdquo;&mdash;he
continued, gazing on the lifeless form he
held, with feelings that almost deprived him of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
utterance,&mdash;&ldquo;and find a creature so perfectly
innocent, so simple, so gentle, and so kind, that
has been made its victim, I am obliged to regret
that it has been purchased at so fearful a
sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was answered only by hysteric sobs, that
in a few minutes were succeeded by violent
convulsions: and Dr. Tourniquet entering the
cabin at this moment, Oriel hastily explained
what had transpired; left her to his care, and
rushed upon deck.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_X" id="CHAP_X">CHAP. X.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">A FIGHT AT SEA.</span></h2>


<p class="noi">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">A sail</span> to leeward!&rdquo; shouted the look-out
man on the gangway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me my glass, Loop!&rdquo; cried the
Captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does she look like, Cap&rsquo;ain,&rdquo; inquired
Climberkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see nothin&rsquo; yet but a tall spar, pointing
pretty sharpish into the sky,&rdquo; said Hearty.
&ldquo;Now I observe she has her royals set, and
has an unkimmon low hull. But take the glass
yourself, and see what you can make of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s schooner built, sir, with raking masts,
carries a smartish number o&rsquo; guns, and is altogether
as suspicious looking a craft as ever I
seed,&rdquo; observed the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which way does she steer?&rdquo; inquired the
old man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s bearin&rsquo; right down upon us, sir,&rdquo;
replied Climberkin; &ldquo;and she means mischief,
or I&rsquo;m pretty considerably mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call up all hands to quarters&mdash;throw
open the ports, and let the guns be shotted;&rdquo;
cried the captain. All was immediately bustle
and confusion in every part of the Albatross.
Fore and aft the men with the utmost alacrity,
prepared to give the strange vessel a proper
welcome in case of an attack. Muskets, pikes,
cutlasses, powder and shot, were handed up
from the hold with as much cheerfulness as if
the crew were commencing some favourite
amusement. The officers were giving their
orders, the men busy at their preparations.
Some threw off their jackets and tucked up
their sleeves to be the more free in their
movements. The decks were cleared: all
things put away that could be an obstacle at
such a time; the guns run out, and every man
was at his post ready for action.</p>

<p>The schooner bore down gallantly upon the
Albatross, and certainly was a very suspicious-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
vessel. A shot from one of her carronades
came booming along without doing any
mischief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistaking that, captain;&rdquo; said
Oriel Porphyry, who had been watching the proceedings
around him with considerable interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a pirate, sir, there&rsquo;s not a doubt
on &rsquo;t,&rdquo; observed the old man; &ldquo;but she&rsquo;ll find
we are not to be caught napping; and as she&rsquo;s
ventured to begin the game, we&rsquo;ll just see who
can play at it best. Give her a taste of the
long gun, Boggle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir;&rdquo; replied the second lieutenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must bear a hand in this, Hearty;&rdquo; said
the young merchant, unable to restrain his
eagerness to join in the approaching fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you please, sir,&rdquo; rejoined the captain;
&ldquo;and as we know you are a fighter, and one o&rsquo;
the right sort, we shall be very glad o&rsquo; your
company. Here&rsquo;s a capital cutlass, which is
much at your service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you; I&rsquo;ll go and get my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
arms;&rdquo; replied Oriel, and he immediately left
the deck.</p>

<p>A long brass thirty-two pounder under the
management of an experienced gunner was
now got ready, and fired with such precision
as to make the splinters fly from her hull.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pitch the shot into her as often as you
can load and fire;&rdquo; cried the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir;&rdquo; said the man at the gun.</p>

<p>At this instant, a shot from the schooner
brought down some of the standing and
running rigging of the Albatross, and severed
the jaws of the main-gaff. It was immediately
answered by her long gun, which was kept
rapidly firing, and ploughed up the decks of
the pirate at every shot. During this, the
Albatross by her superiority of sailing, kept
wearing round the schooner, raking her fore
and aft with a most destructive fire. They
were now near enough to see that the decks of
the supposed pirate were covered with men,
among whom the thirty-two pounder had done
considerable mischief. Finding that this sort
of warfare was telling against them, the pirates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
altered their course, made sail, and ranged up
within a cable&rsquo;s length of their opponent, displaying
at the same time in their ship a black
flag soaring up to her main-peak. As they
approached, the sound of many voices came
over the waters, and the crew of the Albatross
distinctly heard the pirates singing in full
chorus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4a">&ldquo;Our ship sails on the wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">On the wave, on the wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Our ship sails on the wave, Captain Death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For free mariners are we, and we ride the stormy sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And our Captain still shall be<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Captain Death! Captain Death!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Our Captain still shall be Captain Death!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;It must be the miscreants we left on the
island of Madagascar;&rdquo; said the young merchant.
&ldquo;I remember that murderous song well; but
we&rsquo;ll strive hard to spoil their singing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scrunch me if we don&rsquo;t make &rsquo;em change
their toon at any rate;&rdquo; exclaimed the old man.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothin in life I&rsquo;ve been so much
wishin for as a &rsquo;portunity to sarve out that ere
double distilled willain Scrumpydike, or Rifle,
or whatever his name is.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And you must leave the other scoundrel to
me;&rdquo; added Oriel Porphyry. &ldquo;I have an
account to settle with him, and if I can get
within reach, he shall not escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pirate ranged up on the quarter of the
Albatross, pouring in her broadside as she
advanced, which was answered with all the
guns that could be brought to bear on that
side of the ship, and then, by a man&oelig;uvre
skilfully executed, the Albatross was made to
wear round the schooner, pouring in a volley
of musketry, till she presented her other side,
from which another sweeping fire belched forth.
The shot crashed through the timbers of the
pirate, committing dreadful slaughter upon her
closely packed deck, and when the smoke
which enveloped her bows cleared away, it
was seen that her foretop-mast had gone, her
sails had been shot through in numerous places,
and a considerable portion of her rigging hung
in ragged shreds. Three cheers from the crew
of the Albatross, and groans, and shouts and
imprecations from the schooner, evinced the
effect the firing had in both ships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>The pirate bore up as if with the intention
of running alongside to board, and poured in
her broadside as she advanced, which killed six
or seven men, and wounded several others;
but her opponent waited till she was within
about three ships&rsquo; length, and then gave her
the contents of all her available carronades.
The mizen and mainmast of the pirate, which
had previously been wounded, now fell by the
board. At this instant the schooner fell foul
of the Albatross on her larboard quarter, and
the pirates made several desperate attempts to
board, but the crew of the other ship kept up
such a murderous discharge of musketry and
small arms from her tops as well as from her
decks, that every attempt was ineffectual, and
the Albatross wearing off, discharged her larboard
quarter-deck guns, and such of the
main-deck guns as could be brought to bear,
into the schooner&rsquo;s larboard bow.</p>

<p>The excitement on board the Albatross was
now at its height. Every man was at his post,
and one spirit seemed to stir the whole. The
wounded were carried down to the surgeon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
soon as their hurts were known, and the dead
thrown into the sea that they might not incommode
the living. Oriel Porphyry continued in
one of the most exposed parts of the ship encouraging
the men, and firing a musket whenever
the ships were near enough for him to do
so with any effect. Broadside after broadside
followed from the Albatross in rapid succession,
sweeping the decks of the schooner, and splitting
her timbers into fragments. But the
pirate captain still made every exertion to
board the merchant ship. His vessel was
scarcely manageable, and nearly half her crew
were either killed or wounded: but he bore up
to his opponent with the same dauntless resolution
that had distinguished him throughout
his career; he cheered his men on to the fight;
and continued to discharge every gun that
could be brought into play.</p>

<p>A quick and well-directed fire of musketry
was kept up from the tops and forecastle of the
Albatross, and her quarter deck guns were
discharged with scarcely any intermission and
with dreadful effect. The schooner now fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
on board the merchant ship on the starboard
quarter, and the pirates lashed her bowsprit to
the stump of their mainmast; but the lashings
soon afterwards gave way, and the two vessels,
yard-arm and yard-arm, continued to pour into
each other their sweeping broadsides, very
much to the advantage of the Albatross, who
was crippling her opponent at every discharge,
and slaughtering her crew.</p>

<p>At this time the main-mast of the pirate fell
over the side, and as the smoke cleared away,
she was seen with her ports jammed in, her
decks torn up in several places, her hull battered,
and every part of her wearing the appearance
of a complete wreck. But Captain
Death was not a man to think of surrendering.
When his vessel became short of hands, he
assisted in working a gun; and as soon as he
could get the two ships close alongside, he
headed a party that lashed them together, and
then, followed by the remainder of his crew&mdash;men
of all nations, of all colours, and of every
kind of costume, rushed upon the deck of
the Albatross.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>The fight now became one of hand to hand.
The pistol, the pike, and the cutlass seemed the
only weapons in requisition. The crew of the
Albatross hurried to the place where Captain
Death, Lieutenant Rifle, and their followers
were hewing their way with the most desperate
valour. Oriel Porphyry, the captain, Climberkin,
and Boggle headed their party, cheering
them on, and cutting down their opponents.
Oriel Porphyry was engaged with a gigantic
negro, whose head he severed at a blow, and
then attacked a second and a third with the
same spirit, and with a similar effect. Old
Hearty beheld his ancient enemy, first known
to him by the name of Scrumpydike, and frantic
with the remembrance of what he had once suffered
at his hands, he rushed upon him, cutlass
in hand. A pistol was discharged at his head as
he advanced which missed its object, and the
two were immediately engaged in hacking at
each other with all their strength and skill.
The old man in strength was the equal of his
opponent, but he was his superior at the weapon,
at which he had been practising ever since their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
previous fight, with the desire of having his
revenge should they meet again. The struggle
was a fierce one, but it was brief. Hearty cut
his opponent&rsquo;s sword-arm above the elbow with
such force that it severed the bone, and at the
same moment the young midshipman Loop run
him through the body with a boarding-pike.
With a malignant scowl he fell dead on the
deck.</p>

<p>Oriel Porphyry had endeavoured to come in
contact with the pirate captain, whom he observed
at a short distance from him cutting
down all by whom he was opposed; but several
times he was attacked by some other of the
gang whom he was obliged to dispose of before
he could have the slightest chance of getting
at him. At last Captain Death saw his former
companion, and freeing himself from those with
whom he was engaged, he hurried towards him,
waving his uplifted sword streaming with blood,
and shouting exclamations of rage and defiance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is you I have sought far and near since
you escaped me, but there&rsquo;s no escape for you
now;&rdquo; muttered the pirate, as he rushed furiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
upon the young merchant, and strived by
the force and rapidity of his blows to bring the
combat to a speedy termination. But he was
engaged with one of the most accomplished
swordsmen in existence, with a well-tried weapon,
and a spirit burning to destroy the wretch
with whom he fought. He parried dexterously,
and warded off with the greatest ease the most
furious blows that were aimed at him; and the
blood flowing from wounds in the captain&rsquo;s
head and shoulder soon proved that he was not
content with acting merely on the defensive.
During the struggle these two got separated
from the other combatants, and they stood in
a part of the deck unnoticed by the men engaged
on either side. Death, smarting from
his wounds, pressed upon his antagonist with
increasing rage and violence; but the latter,
knowing that the victory was in his own hands,
allowed the other to exhaust his strength in
unavailing blows; then when he found the
pirate&rsquo;s exertions slacken, his sword flashed
about with a rapidity that baffled the eye, and
seemed to draw blood at every stroke. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
followed him with a strength of arm that appeared
perfectly irresistible, beating down his
defence, and striking aside his blows; but just
as he was hurrying forward to put a finishing
stroke to the contest, he tumbled over a dead
body, and fell unarmed at the feet of his foe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo; shouted the pirate chief, while a
gleam of malignant satisfaction shot from his
eyes; &ldquo;your doom is sealed.&rdquo; He swung round
his sabre to bring it with all his strength upon
the head of his defenceless antagonist, but before
the blow had time to descend he heard a
slight shriek, a rush of feet, and the next moment
received two pistol bullets in his body.
Oriel Porphyry regained his footing as Captain
Death fell staggering on the deck, and with a
wild cry of exultation Eureka rushed into his
arms.</p>

<p>The pirates on the fall of their leader became
dispirited; but knowing what would be
their reward if taken, they returned to their
ship, fighting desperately every inch of the way,
and the strife was renewed upon their own deck
till every man of them was cut down. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
crew of the Albatross had upon the termination
of the conflict dispersed themselves over
the schooner with the intention of securing
whatever valuables she might contain, when
they were obliged to make a rapid retreat to
their own vessel, as the schooner was rapidly
sinking, but they did not depart without bringing
with them a prisoner whom they had found
secreted in the hold. The lashings were immediately
cut away, and the Albatross had just time
to sheer off, when the pirate filled and went down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, master Log!&rdquo; exclaimed Boggle to
his trembling prisoner; &ldquo;I likes to ha&rsquo; particular
notions o&rsquo; things in general, as every man as is
a man and thinks like a man should have, and
I has a notion o&rsquo; you as is werry particular;
arn&rsquo;t you a willain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A villain&mdash;a villain&mdash;a great villain&mdash;a
very great villain&mdash;indeed I may say a pretty
considerable, atrocious, abominable tarnation
villain, mister Boggle!&rdquo; cried the other with
a look that showed that he had been entirely
put out of conceit of himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you says true&rsquo;s parfectly right,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the second lieutenant; &ldquo;and I must pay you
the compliment to acknowledge as how you
shows a deal o&rsquo; gumption in your &rsquo;splanation o&rsquo;
your own character. Don&rsquo;t you desarve to be
spiflicated?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spiflicated&mdash;spiflicated&mdash;well spiflicated&mdash;regularly
spiflicated&mdash;I must confess that I
ought to be right down regularly spiflicated,
smothered, smashed, dished up and done for;&rdquo;
acknowledged the unfortunate captain&rsquo;s clerk,
with a most woeful physiognomy and a sincerity
of manner that carried conviction to his
hearers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I likes to make ev&rsquo;ry fellar comfortable
arter his own fashion,&rdquo; said Boggle, with the
utmost gravity; and then addressing a sailor
who was grinning from ear to ear at a few paces
distant, he cried, &ldquo;I say, Solemnchops! just rig
a noose in the main top gallant halyards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it wi&rsquo; pleasure for the gentleman,
sir;&rdquo; replied the man, benevolently hastening
to execute the command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, master Log, I begs to say as how I
got no notion o&rsquo; hurtin&rsquo; any o&rsquo; your feelins,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
continued the lieutenant; &ldquo;but I considers it
necessary for your health as you should be
hanged. I knows unkimmon well as human
natur&rsquo; is human natur&rsquo;, and in consequence o&rsquo;
that ere I comes to the conclusion as it is the
most properest thing as is for you to make
yourself agreeable to your friends wi&rsquo; a dance
upon nuffin. But afore I leaves you in this
here moloncholy perdickyment, I think &rsquo;t will
be but friendly in me to hint to you as how you
ought to die like a respectable &rsquo;dividual; arn&rsquo;t
you rayther a miserable sinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A miserable sinner!&mdash;a miserable sinner!
a very miserable sinner&mdash;a very shocking miserable
sinner, indeed I may say a very extraordinary
shocking miserable sinner, and no mistake;&rdquo;
cried the unhappy Log.</p>

<p>More dead than alive the trembling wretch
had the noose placed round his neck, and was
run up to the halyards, accompanied by the
consolations of the friendly Boggle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo! what are you about there? Let
that man down directly!&rdquo; shouted the captain
as he approached the scene, and the ex-captain&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
clerk descended upon the deck with a
velocity that sent all the breath out of his
body. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning o&rsquo; this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, sir,&rdquo; replied the second
lieutenant, with his usual gravity; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
say as Master Log be given to drinkin, but I
sartainly seed him just now unkimmonly elewated.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XI" id="CHAP_XI">CHAP. XI.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN DEATH, AND THE
MEETING OF THE SHIPS.</span></h2>


<p class="noi">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">There&rsquo;s</span> no saving his life, don&rsquo;t you see;&rdquo;
remarked Tourniquet, who had discovered that
Captain Death was not quite dead, and had been
examining his wounds. &ldquo;Every effort would
be useless here, all skill unavailing; and there
are many others in imminent danger, to whom
I might be of service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, he moves!&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel Porphyry,
as he stood gazing on the changing
features of the dying pirate.</p>

<p>Captain Death lay extended on his back
on the deck where he had fallen. His sword
was still firmly grasped in his hand, and both
his arms were stretched out nearly at right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
angles with his body. The long silken cap in
which he used to confine his black hair had
fallen off, and the hair fell in disordered masses,
clotted with blood, around his face. He had
allowed his beard and moustachios to grow,
and they now added to the natural ferocity of
his countenance. His jacket, of the richest
velvet, was cut through in several places, and
stiffened with gore, which had run down and
soiled the crimson shawl of embroidered silk he
wore girded round his waist, and had more
conspicuously stained his lower garments of
linen. His face was livid, and his eyes blood-shot,
and the expression which was impressed
upon them kept continually changing from
pain to rage, and from rage to hate. Occasionally
some convulsive movement of the
muscles would more strongly distort his features,
and his body writhed and twisted as if
in great agony. After a long fit of violent
shuddering, which shook every part of his
body, his face assumed a more tranquil expression,
and his lips moved as if with an effort
to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Virgo!&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis your father.
He comes to drag me to the halter. See how
he glares at me! He laughs. He shows me
his chains. No, no, no! &rsquo;Tis not that savage
old man. &rsquo;Tis not him. There is no one.
Come to me, my preserver, come to me; and
let the refreshing purity of your caresses drive
away the evil thoughts which have made my
nature so abandoned and desperate. There
is the little bed, with its clean white curtains;
there are the flowers. There, there! I see
you all again, reminding me of a state of innocence
I was unworthy to share. Come, my
preserver, come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is delirious, don&rsquo;t you see;&rdquo; observed
the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think there is any possibility of
his recovering?&rdquo; inquired the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest; he won&rsquo;t live an hour;&rdquo;
replied Tourniquet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel; &ldquo;he speaks
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Virgo! &rsquo;tis time to rise. See how the
rosy morning dawns upon the room! Let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
kiss you before you leave me: there! my soul
is on my lips, and I drink in a better life from
yours. Draw around the curtains. My face
is on the pillow; I cannot see you, but my
blessings follow you wherever you go. Ah!
you leave the room, and all is strife and hate
and passion within me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s talking of that young creature that
was so fond of him, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; said the
doctor; &ldquo;though for my part I can&rsquo;t comprehend
what she could see in him to
like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no knowing,&rdquo; replied Oriel Porphyry;
&ldquo;the love of woman is a mystery
which none properly understand and few appreciate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo; exclaimed the pirate in a
heart-broken voice; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s dead! the innocent,
the good, the gentle, the fearless, the
confiding one, who would have plucked the
rank weeds from my sinful nature, has perished
and left me none like her in the world. She
died for me&mdash;for me, a wretch unworthy to
breathe in her presence. All is lost. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
is no goodness now remaining on the earth.
She&rsquo;s dead! she&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not think he had so much natural
feeling in him;&rdquo; said the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing so evil but what has some
good in it, don&rsquo;t you see;&rdquo; replied the surgeon.</p>

<p>The expression in the features of Captain
Death now underwent a complete change: it
became fierce, daring, and revengeful. His
body appeared violently agitated, and his arms
moved with convulsive twitches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pipe all hands to quarters!&rdquo; shouted the
dying pirate with all his remaining strength.
&ldquo;Make sail&mdash;clear away for fighting&mdash;run
out the guns and shot them.&mdash;She&rsquo;s a rich
merchantman, and there&rsquo;s enough in her to
enrich us all. Pour out a broadside&mdash;there
goes her main-mast:&mdash;another, and her mizenmast
goes by the board. Sweep her quarter
deck with our quarter deck guns, and pour
down upon her a fire of musketry from the
tops. Board her by the bow-sprit. Now,
boys, follow me and cut down all.&rdquo; Here the
features of the dying pirate became absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
terrific, and he made some desperate struggles
to rise from the ground, in which he at last
succeeded; when, waving his sword round his
head, he sung in a piercing voice&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6a">&ldquo;We stifle ev&rsquo;ry cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Ev&rsquo;ry cry,&mdash;ev&rsquo;ry cry&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We stifle ev&rsquo;ry cry, Captain Death!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then we spread our sails that are filled with welcome gales,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Singing, &lsquo;Dead men tell no tales,&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Captain Death! Captain Death!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Singing, &lsquo;Dead men tell no tales,&rsquo; Captain Death.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; screamed the singer, while an expression
of the most intense agony distorted
his features. He dropped the sword he had
held; he drew both his hands suddenly to his
wounded side, and staggering back, gasping
frightfully for breath, he fell violently on his
back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead, don&rsquo;t you see;&rdquo; said the
doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sail on the starboard quarter;&rdquo; cried a
man aloft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more pirates, I hope;&rdquo; exclaimed Fortyfolios,
who had just ventured on deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not quite impossible, don&rsquo;t you see;&rdquo;
was the surgeon&rsquo;s encouraging reply, and both
almost immediately descended the hatchway,
one to look after his patients, and the other to
look after himself. Oriel Porphyry hastened
to the captain, whom he found standing in the
waist, examining the distant vessel through a
glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any more fighting preparing for us?&rdquo;
inquired the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t exactly say yet, sir, but it&rsquo;s best to
be prepared;&rdquo; replied old Hearty, as he gave
some orders to the men around him. &ldquo;She
looms large, and looks as if she was arter
standing right across our fore-foot. Now she&rsquo;s
alterin her course, and is comin with all sail
set right down upon us. Call all hands to
quarters: Climberkin, let the guns be shotted,
and the dead bodies flung into the sea;&mdash;and
yet I think she&rsquo;s a merchantman. Scrunch
me, if it arn&rsquo;t my old ship, the Whittington!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, my father&rsquo;s vessel?&rdquo; asked Oriel
Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very same!&rdquo; cried the old man with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
delight. &ldquo;I knows her better nor any ship I
ever sailed in. No doubt she wants to speak
with us. Bring her head up to the wind,
helmsman! I wonder whether my old captain
is alive still? He was a right-down trump.
But what a mazement he&rsquo;ll be in to find me in
command o&rsquo; the Albatross.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know Captain Barter well. I&rsquo;ve met
him frequently at my father&rsquo;s table, and a very
gentlemanly, sensible man he is;&rdquo; said the
young merchant. &ldquo;I have no doubt he&rsquo;s
brought me some communication from Columbus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall soon see, sir, as we shall be
alongside very shortly;&rdquo; observed Hearty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is master Oriel Porphyry on board?&rdquo; was
shouted from the Whittington, as the ships
neared each other. Oriel caught up a speaking
trumpet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Captain Barter, I am here;&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will come on board, sir, if you please, as
soon as a boat is lowered;&rdquo; said the captain of
the Whittington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any communication for me from
my father?&rdquo; inquired Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have, sir; and &rsquo;tis of great consequence,&rdquo;
replied the other.</p>

<p>Oriel Porphyry was now all anxiety and
impatience to know the intelligence he was
promised. He hurried to the quarter-deck to
receive his visitor, and strode backwards and
forwards with hasty steps till he made his
appearance. Now he thought that the news
must be bad, and in a moment after he imagined
that it was good. One instant he anticipated
the death of his father, and in the next, hoped
that he had been raised by his fellow-citizens to
the highest honours in the nation. And in this
way his mind continued changing its impressions
for the better and for the worse, till he had
worked himself into a state of considerable
excitement, when Captain Barter advanced
towards him.</p>

<p>He was an elderly man, of gentlemanly appearance;
neat in his dress, and polite in his
deportment. His face was pale, and slightly
marked with wrinkles; and his features were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
mild and pleasing. His hair was gray, and his
body rather thin; but he was perfectly upright
in his walk, and his step was firm and manly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I regret I have unpleasant intelligence to
communicate to you, sir,&rdquo; said Captain Barter,
after they had exchanged the customary salutations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is then as I suspected,&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel
Porphyry, earnestly. &ldquo;My father is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, it is not so bad as that,&rdquo; replied
the captain, as if hesitating in making the
communication.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it then? let me know immediately.
I am sure by your manner it is something
dreadful,&rdquo; cried the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father is a prisoner,&rdquo; said Captain
Barter, with a look of sincere commiseration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they dared?&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am sorry to say it is worse than that,
sir,&rdquo; added his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! what is it? Do not keep me in suspense&mdash;I
implore you to tell me,&rdquo; cried the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is ordered for execution,&rdquo; said the
captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The miscreants!&rdquo; muttered the young merchant.
&ldquo;But I knew it would be so. I knew
they would not rest satisfied with their privileges
curtailed. I knew they would seek the
first opportunity to regain their lost power. I
was convinced that they would regard my
father as their enemy, and sacrifice him on the
earliest occasion. But tell me how it was
brought about? I would know all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the revolution, which effected those
important changes in the government of which
you have been informed,&rdquo; said Captain Barter,
&ldquo;nothing could have exceeded the appearance
of good will which existed in every part of the
empire. The emperor seemed desirous of
nothing so much as gratifying the people; and
his ministers appeared to emulate each other in
endeavouring to become popular. Public fêtes
were given in honour of the revolution, at which
the emperor assisted in person; and measures
of the most liberal character were passed
through the legislature, without a division.
All was harmony and social order. The citizens
congratulated each other on the improved state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
of the country&mdash;the industrious classes found
themselves provided with sufficient employment,
at a fair recompense&mdash;trade again became
brisk&mdash;commerce flourished; and abundance
seemed to be generally diffused over the whole
surface of Columbia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mere trick!&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel Porphyry;
&ldquo;nothing but an artifice to lull the people into
a fancied security, I&rsquo;ll wager my existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so, sir,&rdquo; replied the captain. &ldquo;The
leaders of the people had now nothing to complain
of. Every improvement was made before
they had time to offer a suggestion on the subject;
and that being rendered comparatively
useless, they quickly lost their influence over
their fellow-citizens. Your father, observing
how well things were proceeding, withdrew
himself from all participation in politics, considering
that his services were no longer required,
and devoted himself to his commercial
pursuits, and to the realisation of those philanthropic
desires that have distinguished every
portion of his existence. He became again so
completely the private citizen, that no person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
unaware of the circumstances could have
imagined that he had recently played so important
a part in the late changes. All the
most influential of the popular leaders gradually
retired into private life in the same manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see the scheme,&rdquo; cried Oriel, eagerly.
&ldquo;The vile treachery becomes manifest. How
well &rsquo;twas planned. How artfully designed.
Oh! these planners and plotters are a brilliant
set; they are too wise for us poor citizens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they proved, sir,&rdquo; continued the captain;
&ldquo;for while the things I have related were
being done, the government gradually and imperceptibly
concentrated a military force in
the metropolis, by calling in portions of the
garrisons distributed over the empire; and these
were well supplied with all the necessaries of
war, and liberally paid, and officered by men
upon whom the government could depend. Soon
after this, on the pretence that they were no
longer necessary, the national guards were disbanded
and deprived of their arms. Suspicion
was now created among the sharp-sighted few;
but the public generally did not appear to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the slightest notion of the danger which threatened
them. As the object of the emperor and
his party began to assume a more threatening
aspect, the leaders of the people took the alarm,
and endeavoured to awaken their fellow-citizens
to a sense of their danger. In the course of a
few hours every one of them was securely lodged
in a dungeon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And my father amongst them,&rdquo; exclaimed
the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He appears to have been the chief object
at which their malice was directed,&rdquo; observed
the captain. &ldquo;At this time it was thought
necessary to throw off the mask. The old
ministers were restored to their forfeited privileges
and possessions; and your father&rsquo;s implacable
foe, Philadelphia, was placed at the head
of the government. An imposing force of soldiery
was kept continually under arms, to prevent
any rising of the populace; and seizures of
concealed arms were made in every direction.
The people, deprived of their leaders and of
their weapons, felt themselves powerless. They
saw too late the trap into which they had fallen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
They beheld the despotism that was approaching
them, and were unable to make the slightest
effort to defend themselves from its approaches.
Domiciliary visits were now made, upon the
most frivolous pretexts, to the houses of the
principal citizens; and papers and arms were
seized, and their owners, if they gave the
slightest cause of offence, were hurried to prison.
Any one known or suspected of entertaining hostile
intentions was seized and incarcerated, and
fined in heavy penalties, or sent out of the country.
The citizens were confounded, and appeared
utterly unable to make the slightest resistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish I had been there!&rdquo; exclaimed
Oriel, eagerly, &ldquo;I would have infused such a
spirit into their natures as should have made
them ready to rush upon their oppressors with
a certainty of success; and that conviction should
have insured their triumph. I would have made
their hearts astir with the love of freedom, till all
obstacles in their way should have been as straws
in the path of the tempest. I would have made
them fight like lions&mdash;I would have made them
conquer like men. But what became of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
father? you have not told me that. Tell me
what became of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While they were placing the citizens in a
degree of subjection fit for their purpose,&rdquo; replied
Captain Barter, &ldquo;with a monstrous deal
of unnecessary parade, they were making preparations
for the trial of the leaders of the people.
The long-expected day came, and its proceedings
were watched with eager interest by the
citizens, although they dared not show the
anxiety they felt. Master Porphyry, with his
companions, were arraigned as rebels and traitors,
accused of murder and treason, and reviled
by the hired advocates of the crown in terms
which only the more exposed the badness of
the cause they defended. Philadelphia was
president of the Chamber of Peers, by whom
they were tried; and he took every occasion to
abuse, brow-beat, and threaten your father in
language the most intemperate that can be imagined;
but your father replied in a manner
that would have conciliated a savage. His
language was mild, his bearing noble; and
when he was called upon to make his defence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
he made one of the most eloquent speeches
that had ever been heard within those walls.
He merely related what he had done, and what
were his reasons for so doing; exposed the
errors of the government, and the mischiefs to
which they had led; recounted the share he had
had in the revolution, which had reduced the
power of the crown and of the aristocracy to
reasonable limits, and the motives which induced
him to use all his influence in the contest:
and his defence so utterly annihilated the
charges brought against him, that he must have
been acquitted had he been treated with any
thing like justice; but his judges were his
accusers, and they sealed his doom before
they entered upon his trial. The prisoners
were all found guilty. Some were sent into
exile, some imprisoned for life, some were
heavily fined&mdash;and Master Porphyry was condemned
to be beheaded, and to have all his
property confiscated to the crown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The murderous and insatiate tyrants!&rdquo; exclaimed
the young merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Philadelphia delivered the sentence,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
continued the captain, &ldquo;he appeared to take a
malignant joy in having such an opportunity
for reviling your father&mdash;there was no name
of opprobrium he did use: but your honoured
parent replied to him only with a look of wonder
and pity; and with a bow to his relentless judges,
left the court in company with his guards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noble old man!&rdquo; cried Oriel, earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as the people learned the result of
the trial, they were in the deepest affliction,&rdquo;
added Captain Barter, &ldquo;that the kind and excellent
philanthropist&mdash;the true and disinterested
patriot, the glory of their city, and the pride of
the world&mdash;should perish on a scaffold, was more
than they could endure. But they had no leaders,
and no weapons; and, although they would
have risen in a mass in his rescue, under the
circumstances of the case they saw that any
attempt of the kind was utterly hopeless. All
eyes were then turned toward you. Your character
had already acquired their admiration; your
relationship to Master Porphyry excited their
devotion; and, knowing that you had departed
on a voyage, the most powerful friends of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
father met secretly for the purpose of devising
some plan by which they could make you
acquainted with your father&rsquo;s danger, and with
their desire to assist in his rescue. With this
idea in view, all your father&rsquo;s vessels that could
be sent to sea, besides a vast number of ships
belonging to other merchants who had volunteered
to give their assistance, sailed in quest
of you. From knowing something of the plan
of voyage designed by your father I imagined
that about this time you would be crossing the
Atlantic; so here I have been sailing about
for the last two days, and there are nearly a
hundred sail of merchant vessels in the same
pursuit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sail on the larboard bow!&rdquo; shouted a
man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is one of them, I have no doubt, sir,&rdquo;
observed Captain Barter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sail on the starboard quarter!&rdquo; shouted
another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is another, sir!&rdquo; added the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sail to leeward!&rdquo; cried a third.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall have them all about you soon, sir,&rdquo;
said Captain Barter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sail in every point o&rsquo; the compass,&rdquo;
cried Climberkin, as he swept the horizon
with his glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you so, sir,&rdquo; continued the captain.</p>

<p>Climberkin was right. Wherever the eye
could gaze the spars of a vessel were seen rising
from the wave; and, apparently, as soon as
each ship discovered the Albatross, she made
all sail towards her. It was a beautiful sight
to see them approaching, most of them with
every stitch of canvass set&mdash;some bearing right
down upon the Albatross, and others making
tacks; while the distant cheers of their crews,
answered by the crews of the Whittington and
the Albatross, increased the stirring character
of the scene. As soon as they were near enough
a boat was seen putting off from each vessel; and,
a few minutes after, the captains of the different
ships came on board the Albatross, and sat
with Oriel Porphyry in his cabin for several
hours, in deep and earnest conference.
These had scarcely departed when others arrived.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
New vessels kept continually approaching.
As fast as one party left the ship others
made their appearance, and at last the Albatross
was surrounded by an immense fleet. All their
commanders having at last communicated with
Oriel Porphyry, they crowded sail for Columbia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; exclaimed the young merchant,
after the last of his visitors had departed, &ldquo;are
you sure of the crew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To a man, sir,&rdquo; replied old Hearty.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s such a stir in the ship as never was
afore. They are all impatient to be led against
your enemies. I never saw such enthusiusiasm
in all my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep them in that humour, captain,&rdquo; said
Oriel Porphyry. &ldquo;Let every man have a good
supply of ball cartridges, a musket, a pair of
pistols, and a cutlass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And let a party be formed who can use the
hatchet and crow-bar with good effect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And get the carpenter to make carriages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
for the larger guns, so that they can be dragged
by ropes upon the land; and let them be
manned by picked men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir: and if we don&rsquo;t rescue your
honourable father out o&rsquo; the clutches o&rsquo; them
ere lubbers, I&rsquo;m spiflicated if we don&rsquo;t diskiver
the reason why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far are we from port?&rdquo; asked Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About two days sail, sir,&rdquo; replied the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall be too late if the greatest despatch
is not used,&rdquo; observed the young merchant,
earnestly. &ldquo;I rely upon your using every
effort that your skill can suggest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do every thing, sir, as a mortal cretur
can do!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man. &ldquo;I arn&rsquo;t the
fellow to stand shilly-shally at such a time as
this. I&rsquo;ll look to every thing myself, and see
about it immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain had scarcely left the cabin, and
Oriel had thrown himself back in his seat, in
deep and earnest meditation, when he was disturbed
by a knock at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;May I enter, Oriel?&rdquo; said Eureka, as she
gently opened the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, dearest!&rdquo; replied Oriel Porphyry,
as he hastened towards her, and led
her into the cabin, with her hands clasped
in his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are kinder to me than I deserve,
Oriel,&rdquo; murmured his fair companion, with a
look of gratitude from her lustrous eyes that
he found perfectly irresistible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all, my Eureka!&rdquo; said her lover,
affectionately; &ldquo;am I not indebted to you for
life and liberty, and all that render them valuable?
Do I not know how much you have
dared and endured for my sake? And do you
think it possible, that with a knowledge of these
things, I can regard you with any other feeling
than that of the most devoted affection? No,
Eureka, I must love you while I have life.
But how cleverly you continued the disguise.
When I first saw you, I recognised in the
handsome page a resemblance to features it
was impossible for me not to notice; but your
scheme was so admirably managed that I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
entertained the slightest suspicion of your true
character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor up to the present moment has any
one in the ship,&rdquo; replied Eureka. &ldquo;They only
know me as Zabra, except that worthy creature,
Tourniquet, who discovered my secret
when I was wounded, and I immediately made
him aware of my history and object in joining
you, at which he was so much delighted as to
proffer his assistance in carrying on the deception;
and I should have been discovered but for
him on more than one occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That accounts for his confusion at the
tiger-hunt,&rdquo; observed Oriel; &ldquo;and for what
I considered the mystery in your behaviour.
But there is nothing strange or unaccountable
in it now. I only wonder at you. I am
amazed when I think of your risking so much
for one who is so little worthy of such extraordinary
devotion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not love me the less for it, will
you?&rdquo; inquired Eureka, gazing in his face with
a look of thrilling tenderness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love you less, Eureka!&rdquo; exclaimed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
young merchant; &ldquo;that would be ungrateful!
While I have an appreciation of truth and excellence
and fidelity, and that wonderful intellectual
power you have so often exhibited, the
admiration with which I regard you must approach
idolatry. You are a creature to be
proud of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet I am afraid I shall lose you,&rdquo;
said his companion, anxiously; &ldquo;I have just
heard upon what errand you are hastening. It
is full of danger. It is beset by perils. But
the cause is a proud one, and I do not attempt
to dissuade you from proceeding with it. Go
on your career of glory. Give your impetuous
soul free scope for the developement of its
energies. Think not of me, except the thought
can nerve your arm and strengthen your resolution.
Be as daring as your fearless nature
prompts you to be. With such an end in view
as that you have before you, I can allow myself
no other sense, or impression, or emotion than
that which may accompany my earnest hopes
for your success. I have come to a resolution
to forget my own selfish feelings. It is time I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
should. Your advancement, your greatness,
your fame, are the objects to which any thoughts
must now always incline. If you live to triumph
over your enemies, and to attain that
eminence whereon you are so desirous of being
placed, and to which you will do so much
honour, none will rejoice more sincerely than
she who has shown herself so anxious to insure
your happiness&mdash;if you die&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eureka, my adored!&rdquo; rapturously exclaimed
Oriel, pressing her to his breast, as
he noticed that she was unable to proceed,
&ldquo;there is no fear of such a result. Believe
me you alarm yourself unnecessarily. I shall
succeed, I am assured of it: I shall succeed to
have the proud enjoyment of glorifying you
with my pre-eminence. I feel convinced that
if we can only arrive in time, I shall rescue my
father. Nothing shall stop me&mdash;I will not be
defeated: and if we should be too late for this
great object, which I see no reason to apprehend,
I will not rest satisfied till I have
punished his murderers. I have no dread of
death; but if I should die, I shall die a death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
worthy of the lover of Eureka. I shall die in
endeavouring to rescue my country from its
oppressors.&mdash;I shall die in avenging the murder
of one of the noblest and best of men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One word more, Oriel&mdash;one word more,&rdquo;
said Eureka. &ldquo;I have only to ask you, as a
testimony of your love for me, that, if in the
coming conflict you should meet my father, you
will not kill him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He deserves little mercy at my hands,&rdquo;
replied the young merchant. &ldquo;But your desire
is natural, and I will comply with it. He must
answer for his crimes to the country they have
disgraced. And now let us go on deck, a little
fresh air would do neither of us any harm; and
when you behold the noble fleet that has joined
me in my enterprise, I hope that all your
apprehensions will vanish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the crew of the Albatross the intelligence
of the events which had occurred in
Columbia created an extraordinary sensation;
and as soon as it was known that Oriel Porphyry
designed attempting his father&rsquo;s rescue,
every man in the ship volunteered to assist in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the enterprise. Never was such a general
indignation produced as that which burst from
them when they learned the fate to which the
government had doomed Master Porphyry.
A land fight was something new to them, but
they did not prepare themselves for it with less
alacrity, nor were their tongues less active than
their limbs. Various opinions prevailed as to
the best method of bringing about a revolution;
and as to the best form of government which
should replace the old one, there were as
many different notions as tongues to utter
them. A group had gathered together in the
forecastle, where they had been engaged for
some time over an extra allowance of grog,
discussing different political subjects, when
Boggle, who, notwithstanding his promotion,
was amazingly fond of associating with his old
messmates, joined the disputants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, my mates,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;government&rsquo;s tryin to come their handy-dandy
sugar-candy over us, and we arn&rsquo;t a goin
to stand nuffin o&rsquo; the sort. Are we to be
slaves?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; shouted a dozen voices simultaneously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nebber,&rdquo; echoed Roly Poly, with equal
energy, as he was gulping down the contents of
a huge black-jack of hot grog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I likes to have particular notions o&rsquo;
things in general as every man as is a man, and
thinks like a man, should,&rdquo; continued Boggle.
&ldquo;And I must say as how it&rsquo;s my notion that
there&rsquo;s never no occasion for no government
whatsomdever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; remarked the boatswain, who
would have thought it high treason to have
disagreed with his officer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ob coorse,&rdquo; repeated Roly Poly, still pulling
away at the black-jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want no rulers&mdash;there arn&rsquo;t no
&rsquo;cessity for &rsquo;em;&rdquo; said the second lieutenant.
&ldquo;But if we must have kings&mdash;let every man
be his own king.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let every man be his own king,&rdquo; was
echoed from one to another throughout the circle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let ebery man be his own king,&rdquo; repeated
the fat cook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole circumbendibus comes to this,&rdquo;
continued Boggle. &ldquo;If so be as how we&rsquo;re
obligated to pay for what we don&rsquo;t want, it&rsquo;s
hoptional on our parts not to want what we&rsquo;re
obligated to pay for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; said the boatswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sartinly, sar,&rdquo; echoed Roly Poly, endeavouring
to hold his head up, and look as if he
understood what was going forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nuffin but oppression goin on
fore and aft,&rdquo; said the orator. &ldquo;They grinds
the faces o&rsquo; the poor, and makes their bread o&rsquo;
the flour; and therefore we must stand up for
the liberty o&rsquo; the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must stand up for the liberty o&rsquo; the
subject, there&rsquo;s not a doubt on&rsquo;t,&rdquo; remarked
the boatswain, evidently without knowing what
the liberty of the subject expressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;De libty ob de subjack?&rdquo; exclaimed the
fat cook, vainly endeavouring to steady his
position. &ldquo;I like de libty ob de black-jack
best;&rdquo; and so saying, he waddled off after a
very circuitous fashion, with the black-jack
under his arm.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XII" id="CHAP_XII">CHAP. XII.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE CONCLUSION.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> morning dawned slow and sullenly over
the great metropolis of Columbia; and its
immense field of buildings seemed as gloomy
as the skies above them. All the shops were
closed, as if in a time of general mourning;
and the citizens hurried along the streets with
melancholy and unsocial looks. Occasionally,
two or three would stop at a corner of a street
and exchange a few eloquent words and gesticulations;
but the approach of some of the
numerous bands of soldiers that continually
perambulated the streets separated them, and
they continued on their way. Everywhere the
houses looked cheerless, as if they had been
deserted. The shutters were closed, the windows
darkened, and not a sign of life appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
about them. Such of the inhabitants as had
ventured out, appeared to be proceeding in one
direction, communicating with one another
when they could do so without being observed
by the troops. All wore the same aspect&mdash;that
of deep dejection; but, occasionally, a close
observer might have noticed a more fierce
expression in their countenances, as a muttered
execration escaped from their lips.</p>

<p>They passed regiments of horse and foot at
every commanding situation. The whole city
seemed to be filled with them; and their
picquets stationed at regular intervals, patroling
every thoroughfare, prevented any attempt at
revolt on the part of the citizens. Still they
proceeded forward till they entered a spacious
quadrangle, the whole space of which, including
all the avenues that approached it, was filled
with soldiers and citizens. Along the wall of
a high gloomy building, evidently from its
construction a prison, there had been erected a
platform, covered with black cloth. Upon it
appeared a block, and at a short distance from
it a coffin, both covered with black cloth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Around the platform were a troop of horse;
and others were posted along the sides of the
quadrangle, the inner space of which was filled
with a regiment of foot supported by several
pieces of artillery.</p>

<p>At one corner of the principal entrance to
the quadrangle was an ancient stone structure,
very strongly built, from the windows of which
there was a good view of the proceedings before
the prison; at the opposite corner was a similar
edifice, and in their windows and on their roofs
crowds of anxious citizens had congregated.
If any had come with an intention of attempting
a rescue, the disposition of the military was
sufficient to make them despair; and all they
did was to throng as near as possible to the
place of execution, where they stood regarding
the scaffold and its defenders with scowling
looks, and hearts eager for vengeance.</p>

<p>The utmost decorum prevailed among the
multitude. There was no talking or laughing;
and when Master Porphyry made his appearance
upon the scaffold every head was
uncovered, and blessings loud and deep were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
breathed from all. The philanthropist advanced
to the block with a firm step, and
eyes as mild and kind as they had ever
beamed. His look was cheerful, and his
bearing noble and manly. He wore the robe
of honour, which distinguished him as the chief
magistrate of the city, as if desirous of dying in
possession of the dignity to which he had been
raised by the respect of his fellow-citizens.
After bowing in acknowledgment of the recognitions
of the people, he looked unmoved upon
the coffin and the block; and with the executioner
on one side, masked, having a glittering
axe in his hand, and with a priest on the other,
who kept addressing him with pious exhortations,
to which he paid respectful attention, he
advanced to that part of the platform which
overlooked the surrounding multitude. Some
murmurs and execrations had burst from the
spectators at sight of the executioner; but
when it was noticed that Master Porphyry was
about to address them, the vast assembly were
instantly hushed to the most perfect silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My countrymen!&rdquo; exclaimed the philanthropist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
in a clear unbroken voice, &ldquo;I do not
in any way regret the fate that has been prepared
for me, except so far as it prevents me
continuing those offices of social kindness which
made the happiness of my existence. To be
without the means of doing good is scarcely
less desirable than to be in the commission of
evil; and it was a wise and charitable thing of
my persecutors, after having confiscated all my
property, to take away a life no longer of value
to the community.&rdquo;&mdash;A low murmur escaped
from the crowd. &ldquo;I may safely say, and I
proudly say, I have lived for you; and it is an
equal gratification for me to be allowed to
assert, that I die for you.&rdquo;&mdash;Ten thousand
blessings followed the delivery of this sentence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My death, therefore, is not to be considered
pitiable, if regarded in that light. I am
pleased that I have been thought worthy of
this honour. I am delighted that my oppressors
have given me an opportunity of leaving
life with so much satisfaction to myself. Let
me beg of you, therefore, to refrain from any
exhibition of regret for the manner of my death&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
is a very humane one; and my persecutors
have shown me a kindness in allowing me to be
so disposed of.&mdash;I see nothing in it terrible.
I see nothing in it painful. I see nothing in it
of shame or dishonour. &rsquo;T is a blow, and it is
over.&mdash;Had my oppressors wished, I might
have died suffering the most excruciating tortures.
Had I lived, probably I might have
been the victim of some loathsome disease; or
have been deprived of my faculties&mdash;have become
idiotic, or insane, or blind; and at the
last extremity have been deserted by friends,
or left without the means of serving those who
most required assistance. How much better
is it for me to close my existence in this way,
without pain, in the full enjoyment of my reason,
and surrounded by friends; and although
I am rendered incapable of continuing of use
to you, the remembrance of the pleasures I
have enjoyed from a life of active benevolence
is sufficiently agreeable to overpower the regret
I feel in having been left to so unprofitable an
end.&rdquo;&mdash;Again murmurs of applause broke from
all parts of the crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There is however a regret, which is powerful,
and which I require all my philosophy to
endure.&mdash;I regret that I leave my country in a
worse condition than I found her.&mdash;I regret
that the freedom for which I strived so earnestly
is passing away from her people.&mdash;I
regret to see a state of bondage in preparation
for the free hearts around me, which is likely
to deprive them of all their noblest privileges.
I was born a free citizen, and a free citizen I
will die. The galling chains of abject servitude
which are being forged for you shall never disgrace
my nature. Remember, oh, my countrymen,
that freedom is your natural inheritance;
and although it would be madness to attempt
its repossession without sufficient means, never
give up the desire of liberty&mdash;wait the fitting
time; and while you endure, forget not that
the graves of your fathers are disgraced, and
the spirits of your children are being dishonoured.&rdquo;&mdash;The
citizens testified, by loud
shouts and eager exclamations, their assent
to the sentiments expressed by the philanthropist;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
and many were the fierce looks
directed towards the soldiery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there is any man amongst you whom I
have injured, I desire of him most earnestly to
tell me the wrong I have done, that I may
repair it before I die. I am quite certain that
I have never done any one an intentional injury;
but if I have left undone any good which
I might have done, I consider that I have done
an injustice, and would remedy it before it be
too late. Speak, my fellow-citizens; tell me
what injuries against you I have committed.&rdquo;&mdash;There
was an eloquent silence, that lasted for
several minutes. Each man looked at his
neighbour, and all saw that the philanthropist
had no accuser.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one more subject to which I wish
to draw your attention, and it is the last,&rdquo; said
Master Porphyry, in a voice less firm than had
distinguished the delivery of the preceding portion
of his discourse. &ldquo;I have a son. My
persecutors, while punishing me, have thought
proper to make my child a beggar;&mdash;<em>that</em> I
feel. He possesses many good qualities&mdash;many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
good qualities likely to render him an
excellent citizen. Let me bequeath him to
your care.&rdquo;&mdash;A simultaneous shout of assent
from the immense multitude proved that the
appeal had not been made in vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now that I have left nothing undone,
and nothing untold, I must take my leave
of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; was shouted by every voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear friends, it must be,&rdquo; continued
Master Porphyry; &ldquo;I am taking up the time
of these good people; and although it is a
pleasure for me to linger among you, I must
not purchase it at the expense of trouble
to others. I should leave you with a cheerful
heart, if I had not upon me the fear that there
is much suffering preparing for you; and I
should die without an unkind feeling against
any human creature, if I did not possess at
this time a natural indignation against your
oppressors. For myself I have no fear&mdash;those
who have wronged me I forgive; but I have
the feelings of a man and a citizen, and I
cannot forgive the enemies of my country.&rdquo;&mdash;Groans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
and indignant exclamations here rose
on every side. &ldquo;I implore you to desist from
the exhibition of any acts of violence with the
hope of procuring my liberation. There is not
a chance of success. You will be slaughtered
in crowds the first attempt of the kind you
may make. Let not my last moments be made
wretched by seeing your blood shed unavailingly.
If I have done that which seems good
in your eyes, it was with the desire of gaining
your love that I did it. Have I succeeded?&rdquo;&mdash;An
universal shout of assent burst from all
parts of the crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I die with the proudest satisfaction I
could enjoy under the circumstances. I hope
you will raise for me no useless monuments. I
desire that when I am dead my unprofitable body
may meet with no funeral honours. If I have
done that which is honourable, honour me in
your remembrance. If I have done that which
is good, teach your children to do as I have
done. With my best wishes for your happiness&mdash;with
my most earnest aspirations for
your enfranchisement, I can now lay my head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
upon the block. Grieve not because I die: you
should rejoice that your fellow-citizen can die
without dishonour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll avenge you, our benefactor!&rdquo; shouted
a voice from the crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be revenged on your murderers!&rdquo;
exclaimed another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down with the tyrants!&rdquo; cried a third.
Similar exclamations followed, and the masses
of the people seemed in great commotion,
pressing forward towards the soldiery with
groans, hisses, and execrations; but when the
different regiments made a movement forward
and presented their arms as if about to fire,
the multitude fell back, and order was restored
amongst them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of your sins, unhappy man,&rdquo; said the
priest, with a hypocritical visage, who was one of
those bigots who put on the garment, and know
nothing of the spirit, of religion;&mdash;&ldquo;think of
your sins, and repent, for the kingdom of
heaven is at hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would repent, good sir,&rdquo; replied Master
Porphyry, mildly, &ldquo;if I thought I had any thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
of which I could repent; or if I thought I could
do any good by repenting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confess your sins against your God! confess,
and be saved! There is salvation for the worst
of sinners,&rdquo; drawled out the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not aware of having committed any
sins,&rdquo; said the philanthropist; &ldquo;therefore I can
have no confession to make.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How have you served your Creator? What
has been your religion?&rdquo; inquired his companion,
sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have considered that philanthropy was
the only true religion, and I have practised it,&rdquo;
replied master Porphyry; &ldquo;and I felt convinced
that the right way of worshipping God was by
doing all the good in my power to my fellow-creatures;
and from that way I have never deviated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Atheistical, abominable, atrocious, heretical,
and damnable!&rdquo; exclaimed the priest, with a
look of horror. &ldquo;You are in the hands of the
devil. The church renounces you. Flames and
brimstone must be your portion; wailing and
gnashing of teeth your reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The philanthropist looked surprised; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
turning to one of the assistant executioners
who stood at a short distance, he said, &ldquo;I am
ready.&rdquo; The man instantly proceeded to disrobe
him of his upper garment, and arranged
his dress so that the whole of his neck was
bare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather have died in that robe,&rdquo;
observed he; &ldquo;for I like not parting with the
honours that have been bestowed upon me.
However, it is gratifying to know that I have
never disgraced it. It can give me no distinction
where I am going, therefore there let it
lie.&rdquo;&mdash;His countenance every moment appeared
to become more benevolent in its expression;
and there was a nobility in his manner that
commanded respect from all around him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kill me as quickly as you can, my good
friend,&rdquo; said he to the executioner; &ldquo;but
after you have killed me you may do what
you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The citizens had watched with breathless
interest the preparations for Master Porphyry&rsquo;s
execution; but when they beheld him kneel
down before the block, and saw the headsman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
raise his axe, a shudder seemed to pass over
the whole multitude. At this instant a proud-looking
man, in a military costume, appeared
upon the scaffold; and, immediately he was
observed, a yell of execration arose from the
quadrangle, and from every place that could
command a view of the platform. The officer
stood up his full height, and looked down upon
the people with glances of scorn and contempt.
Groans, hisses, and curses became louder and
more general.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death to the persecutor!&rdquo; shouted one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down with the oppressor!&rdquo; cried another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yell on ye wretched rabble!&rdquo; exclaimed
the object of their indignation, his mustachios
curling with a contemptuous sneer, and his eyes
flashing with malignity. &ldquo;It matters not to
me what is said by such vile hounds. Yell on
then, it does my heart good to hear ye; and ye
know full well ye dare not do any thing else.&rdquo;
Then turning round to Master Porphyry, he
said, &ldquo;I have come to testify my loyalty by
beholding the death of a traitor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no traitor here, Philadelphia,&rdquo; replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
the philanthropist, mildly, &ldquo;unless it be
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the hated tyrant!&rdquo; shouted some of
the multitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The curses of the people are upon thee,
thou miserable slave!&rdquo; cried others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down with him! Down with the despot!
Down with the enslaver of his country!&rdquo; exclaimed
the rest. At this instant a banner was
raised near the centre of the quadrangle, with
the inscription upon it, in large letters, of
&ldquo;<strong>Porphyry, or Death!</strong>&rdquo; It was the signal
for an immediate rush towards the scaffold.
With one simultaneous cheer the vast multitude
hurried forwards, burst in upon the
troops, and with frantic rage began to struggle
with them for the possession of their arms. A
volley of musketry from an opposite window at
this moment killed the executioners and several
others, and the rest, with the exception of Philadelphia
and Master Porphyry, took to flight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leap down here, my benefactor, and I will
save you,&rdquo; shouted a voice from beneath the
platform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall not escape me a second time,
my enemy,&rdquo; muttered the noble as he drew his
sword, and with a look of mingled hatred and
ferocity exclaimed, &ldquo;Thus I punish a traitor!&rdquo;
as he drove the weapon through the body of his
companion.</p>

<p>The philanthropist gazed on his murderer,
more in sorrow than in anger; and the only
words he uttered, before he dropped down dead
on the platform, were, &ldquo;<strong>My Brother!</strong>&rdquo; The
miserable fratricide seemed confounded by the
avowal; but little time was allowed him for
reflection. Curses, yells, screams, groans, and
execrations burst from the assembled citizens
as they noticed the death of their chief magistrate;
and Philadelphia fell by his side, pierced
by a hundred bullets. A shout of triumph arose
when they beheld the fall of the tyrant; and,
as if inspirited by the sight, they threw themselves
upon the soldiery in countless masses, and
endeavoured to drag them from their horses, or
wrest their weapons out of their hands. In this
man&oelig;uvre, although it was attended by immense
loss of life, many succeeded; but the strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
and discipline of the troops at last prevailed, and
the citizens were forced out of the quadrangle;
and when the artillery began to play upon them
they dispersed in all directions.</p>

<p>The soldiery were now forming ready to
make a charge in case the people should re-assemble,
when from the stone buildings at the
corner of the avenue a most destructive fire of
heavy cannon was opened upon them. Every
window in the neighbourhood was broken by
the concussion, and the havoc made in both the
horse and foot regiments was excessive. The
word was given for the foot soldiers to endeavour
to take these buildings by assault, and
they marched forward for that purpose; but
directly they came near enough, a continuous
stream of bullets issued from every place that
could command a shot at them, and they fell
back in confusion. Again they advanced to
the assault, pouring in a steady fire at the windows;
but these spaces were blocked up with
sand-bags, allowing only sufficient room for a
ship&rsquo;s gun to be run in and out, and they were
defended by the crew of the Albatross, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
the command of their veteran captain. After
fighting their way through all opposition, assisted
by detachments from the fleet, and by
the citizens, they had dragged the guns through
the city, and when the people made their attack
upon the soldiers, they were preparing their
batteries. The military again came to the attack,
amid the enthusiastic cheers of the brave
sailors; and although they persisted for a long
time in endeavouring to obtain possession of
the buildings, they were repulsed and retreated
in disorder.</p>

<p>The artillery was then brought to bear upon
the place, but scarcely had it been placed in a
proper position, before it was rendered unserviceable
by the destructive fire from the
batteries; and the troops finding that they
were being mowed down without a chance of
silencing their opponents, charged up the
avenue&mdash;the horse supported by the foot
regiments. Here they were met by a fire of
musketry from the houses on each side, and
having passed a short distance amid showers of
heavy missiles, that were hurled down upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
them from the tops of the buildings by the
enraged citizens, they came to a barrier hastily
erected of stones and earth, from which a
murderous fire from three thirty-two pounders
opened upon them as they advanced, throwing
the cavalry into confusion, and causing them to
retreat in disorder upon the infantry.</p>

<p>Here they were joined by a strong reinforcement,
consisting of several thousand fresh
troops, and a charge was made upon the barrier
which, after an obstinate resistance, was forced.
They then proceeded onwards, exposed to a
destructive fire from the neighbouring houses;
but they had not advanced above a hundred
yards, when they were thrown into a complete
derout by the hasty retreat of a regiment of
horse, which fell back upon them, scattering
dismay and terror into their ranks. Shouts of
triumph were heard in the distance, accompanied
by the fierce roar of cannon, and the
rattle of frequent volleys of musketry. While
the whole military force was on the point of
endeavouring to find safety in flight, they were
joined by another large reinforcement, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
cavalry having re-formed as soon as they beheld
the new troops, they moved forward in a body
to where it was evident that a violent contest was
raging. They continued to meet parties both of
horse and foot flying from the scene of action;
and these were received into their ranks.</p>

<p>Having passed through several streets,
fighting at every step, they advanced under
a broad archway into an open park. Here a
tremendous battle was still going on. The
two contending armies were placed opposite
each other, and had been engaged for several
hours attacking each other&rsquo;s positions, and
defending their own. The army of the people
had taken up a position on a slope with a
plantation of fine oak trees on one side, and a
deep but narrow rivulet on the other. Their
centre was composed of the national guards;
their right wing consisted of a body of several
thousand sailors; and their left was a body of
armed citizens equally numerous, supported by
several batteries, and a reserve of cavalry.
They were opposed by the flower of the emperor&rsquo;s
troops; but their superior discipline and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
military skill availed them nothing. Although
the citizens suffered severely from the attacks
which were made upon them, they increased in
numbers every hour. Thousands joined their
ranks; new batteries were raised; and while
the enemy was losing strength, they were
increasing their forces.</p>

<p>Oriel Porphyry, on his landing, made for the
rendezvous which had been agreed upon.
Here he placed himself at the head of his own
regiment of dragoons; with which, assisted by
the citizens from their houses, he attacked
several parties of the military that paraded the
streets. The national guards then began to
make their appearance in great numbers; and
these having provided themselves with arms
from the gun-shops while the young merchant
kept the imperial troops employed, soon collected
together and marched to his assistance.
Finding himself in two or three hours at the
head of a body of nearly twenty thousand men,
willing to follow wherever he led, he left the
street-fighting to the citizens, and sending
several detachments in different directions, so as,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
as much as possible, to divide the attention of
the military, he took up the position that has
been described, in the park, with the intention
of attacking a large body of troops there posted.</p>

<p>The battle began by a division of the imperial
troops attempting to force a bridge over
the rivulet, which was defended by the sailors,
supported by several pieces of cannon. The
attack was continued with great spirit, reinforcements
arriving almost every half hour;
but it was defended with equal bravery, and
the soldiers were beaten back every time with
very great loss. Two regiments of cavalry then
were sent against it, but the bridge being
narrow, only a few could attempt to cross at a
time, and these were brought down by the cannon
and musketry as soon as they made their appearance.
The lower part of the bridge became
blocked up with dead bodies, and the cavalry,
after repeated efforts, were obliged to retreat,
having lost nearly one third of their number.</p>

<p>An attempt was now made on the wood by
a strong party of infantry, while the cavalry
in great force made an attack upon the centre;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
but a strong palisade had been raised among
the trees, from which the citizens, in almost
perfect security, poured a deadly fire upon the
advancing columns, which thinned their ranks
rapidly; and the national guards having formed
into square, as the cavalry advanced, received
them with such streams of bullets, that they
staggered and fell back. They repeated the
attack several times, and always met with the
same result. While these proceedings had
been going on, Oriel Porphyry had given orders
for the sailors to pass the bridge, whom he
supported with his cavalry, and they fell with
irresistible impetuosity upon the left wing of the
enemy, which had been considerably weakened
by its unsuccessful attacks upon the bridge.</p>

<p>The young merchant dashed on at the head
of his dragoons, exhibiting the most daring
valour. He had had three horses killed under
him during the battle, and had been wounded
in several places, but he continued his brilliant
career, making both cavalry and infantry fly
before him. The left wing, after a brief resistance,
gave way, and they were in full retreat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
when they were met by the soldiers who had
been on guard in the quadrangle. Immediately
they fled, he made a desperate attack
upon the enemy&rsquo;s rear, and the national guards
making a charge at the same moment all along
their line, the imperial troops were thrown into
inextricable confusion, and the reinforcement
which made its appearance only came in time
to be mixed up in the general rout. They
were pursued from street to street without the
slightest cessation; and so general was the panic
that spread among them on their retreat, that
they flung away their arms, and dispersed in
every direction.</p>

<p>A few days after the transactions just narrated
the city seemed as if dressed for a festival.
The houses were decorated with garlands of
flowers, flags, and pieces of rich tapestry, and
the windows and house-tops were crowded with
elegantly dressed females, and the citizens in
their holyday-dresses. Every face seemed
breathing gladness, and every eye beamed with
delight. The long thoroughfares were thronged
with spectators, all of whom wore the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
joyful expression of countenance; they were
waiting the expected return of Oriel Porphyry
from his last battle with the enslavers of his
country, in which the emperor had been slain,
and his forces completely discomfited.</p>

<p>Distant shouts of triumph announced the
approach of the young conqueror; and every
neck was stretched out, and every eye turned in
the direction from whence the sounds proceeded.
The cheers of the excited citizens became gradually
more loud, and the impatience of the
inhabitants of the houses more conspicuous.
At last the measured sound of military music
came upon the ear, and in a few minutes the
whole force of the metropolitan national guards
marched by; every regiment with its band
playing and its ensigns waving; after them
came a car, drawn by four milk-white horses,
on which lay the body of the philanthropist
in his robe of honour; it was followed by Oriel
Porphyry, or, to give him his proper title, the
prince of Philadelphia, bare-headed, on a powerful
war-charger, who seemed by his prancings
and curvettings, proud of the noble burden he
carried. Blessings were showered upon him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
from every side; flowers descended on his head,
and all hailed him as the deliverer of his
country. His handsome countenance and manly
figure never appeared impressed with such a
nobility of character as when he bowed in acknowledgment
of the universal enthusiasm
which was excited in his favour. Eureka
rode at his side, expressing by her beautiful
countenance the delight she experienced. His
own regiment of cavalry came next, and they
were followed by the crew of the Albatross, and
of the other merchant vessels that had assisted
him in the struggle. Nothing was heard among
the people but cheering and exclamations of
praise; nothing was seen but the waving of
caps and handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>In the course of the same day Oriel Porphyry
was declared emperor of the Columbians; and
when he ascended the throne of his country
Eureka shared in his glory.</p>
